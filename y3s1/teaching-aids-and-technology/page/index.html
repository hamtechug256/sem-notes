   Learners remember 10% of what they
   <i>
    read
   </i>
   , 20% of what they
   <i>
    hear
   </i>
   , 30% of  what they
   <i>
    see
   </i>
   and 40% of what they
   <i>
    do
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, the teaching tools or technology should be designed and  prepared in a way that learners are given an opportunity to have hands-on  or practice what they are learning.
  </p>
  <h4>
   TYPES (FORMS) OF TEACHING AIDS/TECHNOLOGY
  </h4>
  <p>
   There are various types or forms of teaching aids/technology that can enhance the learning experience. They can be broadly classified into the following categories:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>
      Visual Aids
     </b>
     : Visual aids are teaching tools that can be seen or read by the learners. They help in presenting information in a visual format, making it easier for learners to understand and remember. Examples of visual aids include
     <i>
      charts, whiteboards, maps, models, diagrams, graphs, illustrations, infographics,
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      visual organizers.
     </i>
     These aids facilitate better comprehension and retention of information.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>
      Audio Aids
     </b>
     : Audio aids are teaching tools that produce sound, which is beneficial for learning. They engage the sense of hearing and can be used to deliver audio-based content or support verbal instructions. Examples of audio aids include
     <i>
      headsets, radios, microphones, speakers, audio recordings, podcasts, music,
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      language learning apps.
     </i>
     These aids enable auditory learning and enhance the understanding of concepts through sound.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>
      Audio-Visual Aids
     </b>
     : Audio-visual aids are tools that combine both visual and audio elements. They provide a multisensory learning experience by integrating visual presentations with accompanying sound. Examples of audio-visual aids include
     <i>
      PowerPoint projectors, videos, smart devices (such as smartphones and tablets), multimedia presentations,
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      interactive whiteboards
     </i>
     . These aids offer a dynamic and engaging approach to teaching, incorporating both sight and sound to reinforce learning.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   In addition to these three primary categories, it’s important to note that
   <i>
    <u>
     teachers
    </u>
   </i>
   themselves can be
   <i>
    <u>
     effective teaching tools
    </u>
   </i>
   . They possess the ability to speak, act, dance, and demonstrate various concepts, employing diverse instructional techniques to help learners understand. Their presence and interactive teaching methods contribute significantly to the learning process.
