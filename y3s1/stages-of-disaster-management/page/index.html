            Disaster Management
            a comprehensive range of activities, programs, and measures that can be undertaken before, during, and after
            a disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its primary purpose is to prevent a disaster, minimize its impact, and facilitate recovery from the
            resulting losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disaster Management is an ongoing and integrated process that involves planning and implementing measures
            across various sectors and disciplines. Its aim is to minimize the loss of life, disability, suffering, and
            damage experienced by disaster victims.

        <p>
            Mitigation refers to sustained actions that reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from
            natural hazards and their effects. It involves efforts at the federal, state, local, and individual levels
            to lessen the impact of disasters on families, homes, communities, and the economy.

            The disaster response phase is focused on providing immediate assistance to affected populations to preserve
            life, improve health, and boost morale. While this stage primarily addresses short-term needs, the
            transition to the recovery stage may overlap as certain response actions extend into that phase.

                Minimize casualties if the disaster cannot be averted.

            <li>
                Prevent further casualties after the initial impact.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conduct rapid and minimal-damage rescues.

                Deliver definitive medical care on-site and facilitate quick referrals.

                Introduction
            </em>

        </p>
        <p>
            Community participation in disaster management refers to the process where individuals, families, and
            communities take responsibility for promoting their own health and welfare during times of crisis. The
            Community Health Nurse (CHN) plays a crucial role in connecting professional experts in disaster management
            with the community. It involves community members taking the initiative to develop and sustain their own
            disaster management plans, utilizing locally available resources for planning, implementing, monitoring, and
            evaluating programs.
