        </h1>


        <p>
            Community is a social group determined by geographic boundaries, values, and interests.

            According to WHO (1974),

        </p>
        <p>
            OR
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a group of inhabitants living together in a somewhat localized area under the same general regulations
            and having common interests, functions, needs, and organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            OR
        </p>
        <p>
            A cluster of people with at least one common characteristic (geography, occupation, race, ethnicity, housing
            condition…).
