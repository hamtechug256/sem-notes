            Will: A will is a document created by an individual during their lifetime, wherein they state how their
            property and affairs should be handled after their death.
        </p>
        <p>
            Will: A will is a written document produced by a person while they are alive, clearly instructing how their
            property should be managed or divided following their passing.

            In Uganda, the law governing inheritance is outlined in the
            <strong>
                SUCCESSION ACT
            </strong>
            ,
            <strong>
                Chapter 139
            </strong>
            of the Laws of Uganda, as amended by
            <strong>
                Decree No. 22 of 1972.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This legislation covers the process of creating wills and the subsequent procedures following the death of a
            will-maker. It also addresses the distribution of property when a person passes away without leaving a will.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, customary laws and practices often prevail over the legal provisions, leading to property
            distribution that may not adequately consider the welfare of widows, widowers, and children. Consequently,
            it is crucial for individuals to create a will during their lifetime to ensure that their property and
            assets are distributed according to their wishes.
