                Communication
            </b>
            is the exchange of information/messages between the  sender and a receiver. Therefore communication means
            giving and receiving  information.
        </p>
        <p>
            In teaching and learning communication is the exchange of ideas, feelings and knowledge between the teacher
            and the learner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Communication is effective when the sender of information is well  understood by the audience/receiver. This
            is the ultimate goal of  communication.

                    If both the sender and receiver lack interest in the communication process, it hinders effective
                    communication. When individuals are not engaged  in the conversation, the message may not be
                    received or understood as intended.

                        Inappropriate Channel or Communication:
                    </b>
                    Choosing the wrong channel or mode of communication can hinder effective communication. Different
                    situations and messages require different channels, and using an inappropriate one can lead to
                    confusion or misinterpretation.

                    : Environmental factors such as noise, unpleasant smells, or uncomfortable temperatures can create
                    distractions and hinder effective communication. These obstacles can disrupt concentration and make
                    it difficult for the message to be properly conveyed and understood.

                        Poor Timing
                    </b>
                    : Timing plays a crucial role in effective communication. Communicating at an inappropriate time,
                    such as when someone is busy or preoccupied, can lead to a lack of attention or receptiveness. It is
                    important to choose the right moment to ensure effective communication.
