            ANGER ISSUES IN PALLIATIVE CARE
        </h1>
        <p>

            Anger is the strong emotion that one feels when he/she thinks that someone has behaved in an unfair, cruel 
            or unacceptable way.

        </p>
        <p>

            Anger is a strong feeling of annoyance, displeasure, or hostility.

                Anger
            </b>

            in patients and families is a common problem in the

            <b>
                care
            </b>

            of persons with advanced disease. Whereas  it is widely accepted that

            <b>
                anger
            </b>

            may be a justifiable reaction to significant illness and loss, it frequently  creates difficulties for the
            doctors involved in

            <b>
                care
            </b>

            . In particular, there is often a personal impact on the  doctor at whom anger is directed.

        </p>
        <p>

            Anger is a commonly encountered emotion in the cancer setting. Understanding its origin is vital but the 
            practitioner needs to facilitate more than the ventilation of feelings; some change in attitude, the
            provision  of social support and the promotion of adaptive coping need to be generated.

        </p>
        <p>

            The perceived unfairness of illness and death commonly underpins anger in the patient with cancer.

            Fear is probably the most common source of anger, especially in the dying and their families.

            </b>

            As with any difficult patient situation, communication techniques are especially important so that both the 
            patient and physician do not become further embittered and frustrated.

                    Affect:
                </b>

                Name the emotion; for instance, You seem very angry…. It is crucial to validate feelings so  the angry
                person feels that you are listening. Attempting to defuse it, counter it with your own anger  or ignore
                it, will be counter-productive. Acknowledging their right to be angry will help start the  healing
                process and solidify the therapeutic relationship.

                Explore what scares or troubles them the most about their present and future. Just asking  the question
                Tell me what frightens you? will help them to focus on circumstances they may not have  considered.

                Knowledge and positive action can help mitigate fears and reduce anger. How are they  handling the dying
                – are they making concrete plans about their finances, their things, their  family? Have they thought
                about formal counseling to help deal with depression and anger?

                <b>
                    Empathy:
                </b>

                By displaying empathy and concern you can help the person feel understood, less  abandoned and alone.
                Avoid trite statements such as I know what you’re going  through. Paraphrasing the patient’s comments is
                an effective way to convey that you heard and are  seeking to understand: You feel like it’s so unfair
                that the cancer appeared out of nowhere after all  these years.

                trying to understand that it’s really not easy  being a patient nor to be a relative whose loved one is
                in critical condition because no person would  ever want to be stuck in the hospital for days, and to be
                taken care of by different strangers every  eight to ten hours.

                As a nurse, show empathy by focusing your attention on their feelings, expressions,  and actions and
                show them that you are interested and that they are important.

                    Allow the patient to blow off some steam or ‘calm down:
                </b>

                allowing patients to calm down first before  you give them your explanation i.e. reminding yourself that
                they are not happy about being ill, so it’s  best to just try your best to keep yourself cool while
                waiting for them to calm down.

                </b>

                Try not to get either too close or too far from them i.e.  let them feel that they still have their own
                personal space that you wouldn’t be invading and that they  are safe there.

                    Do not touch them:
                </b>

                Let the patient speak their mind from a comfortable distance, but not too far  that you’d have to shout
                at each other, or too near that you’d be uncomfortable to speak.

                <b>
                    Be sensitive:
                </b>

                Being sensitive to people’s feelings means accepting them and respecting them no  matter what happens
                i.e. if a patient gets mad at you for something, don’t think that he is a bad  patient or person rather
                think about how you would feel if you were in their shoes.

                <b>
                    Be gentle:
                </b>

                If you are to respond, do it in a calm and kind manner and if you want to make the situation  better,
                try to avoid negativity. Instead, focus on something that you can do to help the person i.e.  Think
                before you respond to anything the patient says because sometimes, people react too quickly  without
                taking time to think about how their responses might affect others.

                <b>
                    Do not argue:
                </b>

                Being truthful of everything you say, and try not to think that you are always right.  Communicating
                better and having a positive behavior towards any issue will solve anything.

                    Apologize for the inconvenience:
                </b>

                Apologizing will not make you less of a person; it will only show  that you are strong and brave enough
                to accept your mistakes. It could also lessen any tension that  may occur between you and your patients
                (or their family members).

                    Settle the issues immediately:
                </b>

                Of course, it is best to work on the complaint as soon as you can. The  patient or family member is
                angry for a reason. Make sure to take note of the details of their  complaint and find time to fix it.

                    Keep your promises:
                </b>

                When dealing with patients, you tend to say things you do not mean, and more  often than not, give
                promises that you cannot keep.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Set boundaries:
                </b>

                Keep yourself safe but let them know that you are listening to them i.e. defuse  situations before they
                even escalate e.g. a patient has the right to be involved in their medical  decision-making, but they
                cannot use that right for any unreasonable demands.

                <b>
                    Communicate:
                </b>

                Being honest with everything you say to the patient and being available and  responsive to your patients
                i.e. never let them feel that you are ignoring them.

            <li>
                <b>
                    Acknowledge the emotion that the patient is projecting:
                </b>

                Validating the person’s feelings will help  them feel understood i.e. let them feel that their feelings
                make sense, that you hear them and you  understand them.

                    Listen:
                </b>

                Active listening also means you should look at the problems from the other person’s point of  view i.e.
                focus on what the person is saying to you before offering any help. Remember to take note  of what they
                are saying, and try to retain the information.

                Ask gentle, probing questions to learn more about what the other person  think and feel i.e. ask
                clarifications if you don’t get what the patient is trying to say.
