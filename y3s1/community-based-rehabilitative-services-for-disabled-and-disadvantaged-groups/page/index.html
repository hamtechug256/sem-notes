            Importance of CBRS


        </h4>
        <p>
            Community-based rehabilitative services (CBRS) play a crucial role in supporting disabled and disadvantaged
            individuals who face various obstacles in accessing essential healthcare, education, and employment
            opportunities. These services are essential as they contribute to the overall well-being and quality of life
            of individuals in several significant ways.

                    : CBRS focus on delivering services within local communities, making them more accessible to those
                    who may have difficulty traveling or reaching specialized facilities. By bringing rehabilitative
                    services closer to individuals in need, CBRS ensure that crucial support is available to them
                    without the added burden of long-distance travel or transportation issues.
