            Research Ethics


        </h2>
        <blockquote>
            Ethics refers to the discipline of distinguishing between what is good and bad, involving moral duty and
            obligation.
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It encompasses a set of moral principles or values that guide behavior and conduct.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ethics establishes the principle of conduct governing individuals or groups.
            </li>
            <li>
                In  research, ethics provides guidelines for the responsible conduct of biomedical research. It ensures
                that research is conducted in an ethical manner, with a focus on protecting the welfare and rights of
                research participants.

                In addition, research ethics educates and monitors scientists conducting research to ensure a high
                ethical standard.

            History of Research ethics


        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The development of modern research ethics began from the need to protect human subjects involved in
                research projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first significant attempt to establish regulations occurred during the Doctors Trial of 1946-1947 in
                Germany, which took place after World War II.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Doctors Trial was part of the Nuremberg Trials for Nazi war criminals, where the accused violated
                basic ethical principles.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Nuremberg Code emerged from this trial and comprised ten ethical guidelines that emphasized the
                importance of voluntary consent, societal benefits, scientific basis, avoidance of unnecessary
                suffering, and the prohibition of research with potential harm or death as outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Nuremberg Guidelines laid the foundation for subsequent initiatives, such as the Helsinki
                Declaration, which aimed to promote responsible research with human subjects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another significant document is The Belmont Report, published in 1978 by the U.S. National Commission
                for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, which further defined
                ethical principles in research.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            <em>
                <strong>
                    The Nuremberg Code consisted of ten basic ethical principles that the accused violated.
                </strong>
            </em>


            <br />

        </p>
        <p>

            The 10 guidelines were as follows

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Research participants must voluntarily consent to research participation

            </li>
            <li>

                Research aims should contribute to the good of society

            </li>
            <li>

                Research must be based on sound theory and prior animal testing

            </li>
            <li>

                Research must avoid unnecessary physical and mental suffering

            </li>
            <li>

                No research projects can go forward where serious injury and/or death are potential outcomes

            </li>
            <li>

                The degree of risk taken with research participants cannot exceed anticipated benefits of results

            </li>
            <li>

                Proper environment and protection for participants is necessary

            </li>
            <li>

                Experiments can be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons

            </li>
            <li>

                Human subjects must be allowed to discontinue their participation at any time

            </li>
            <li>

                Scientists must be prepared to terminate the experiment if there is cause to believe that continuation
                will be harmful or result in injury or death.

            </li>

            Why study research ethics


        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Studying research ethics is a reflection of respect for individuals who participate in research studies.
            </li>
            <li>
                It ensures that researchers do not make unreasonable, unsafe, or thoughtless demands on participants.
            </li>
            <li>
                Research ethics ensures the sharing of sufficient knowledge among all concerned parties.
            </li>
            <li>
                It establishes a common standard for ethical conduct, which has become the norm and an expectation in
                research activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Research ethics is a professional requirement in disciplines like nursing.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is also  necessary for accessing participants in health-related research.

            PLAGIARISM


        </h5>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Plagiarism is the act of passing off somebody else’s ideas, thoughts, pictures, theories, words, or
                stories as your own.

        </blockquote>
        <p>

            If a researcher plagiarizes the work of others, they are bringing into question the integrity, ethics, and
            trustworthiness of their research.
