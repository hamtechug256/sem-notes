            Job stress and associated conditions


        </h2>
        <p>

            <em>
                Job stress
            </em>
            is the harmful physical and emotional responses that occur when the requirements of the job do  not match
            the capabilities, resources, or needs of the worker.

        </p>
        <p>

            Job stress matters to our health and our work.

        </p>
        <p>

            When we feel stressed, our bodies respond by raising the concentration of stress hormones in our blood. 
            When our bodies continually respond to constant demands or threats, coping mechanisms stay in overdrive, 
            which can be damaging to health over time

        </p>
        <p>

            Stressful working conditions can also impact health indirectly by limiting our ability or motivation to 
            participate in other health promoting behaviors such as eating well and exercising.

            Stress is not always bad.

        </p>
        <p>

            Stress in the form of a challenge energizes us psychologically and physically, and it motivates us to learn
            new  skills and master our work.

        </p>
        <p>

            When a challenge is met, we feel relaxed and satisfied. This is good stress or


            eustress


            .  However, sometimes a challenge is turned into job demands that cannot be met. This is


            negative stress


            , or


            distress


            , which sets the stage for illness, injury, and job failure.

                    Acute stress

        <p>

            An acute stress reaction occurs when symptoms develop due to a particularly stressful event. The word 
            ‘acute’ means the symptoms develop quickly but do not usually last long.

        </p>
        <p>

            The events are usually very severe and an acute stress reaction typically occurs after an unexpected life
            crisis.  This might be, for example, a serious accident, sudden bereavement, or other traumatic events.
            Acute stress  reactions may also occur as a consequence of sexual assaults or domestic violence. Acute
            stress can also come out of something that you actually enjoy. It’s the somewhat-frightening, yet  thrilling
            feeling you get on a roller coaster or when skiing down a steep mountain slope. These incidents of acute
            stress don’t normally do you any harm. They might even be good for you.  Stressful situations give your body
            and brain practice in developing the best response to future stressful  situations.

        </p>
        <p>

            Once the danger passes, your body systems should return to normal.

        </p>
        <h5>

                <u>
                    Episodic acute stress

            </b>

        </h5>
        <p>

            Episodic Stress occurs when we experience acute stress too frequently.

        </p>
        <p>

            It often hits those who take on too much―those who feel they have both self-imposed pressure and external 
            demands vying for their attention.

        </p>
        <p>

            In such cases, hostility and anger frequently result. Episodic stress also commonly afflicts those who worry
            a  lot of the time, in turn resulting in anxiety and depression.

        </p>
        <p>

            This might also happen if you’re often anxious and worried about things you suspect may happen e.g. certain 
            professions, such as law enforcement or firefighters, might also lead to frequent high-stress situations.

        </p>

        <p>

            Chronic Stress leads to serious health problems, because it disrupts nearly every system in your body.  Part
            of what makes chronic stress so insidious is its ability to become a “normal” feeling. This pattern of 
            enduring is what makes chronic stress such a serious health issue.

        </p>
        <p>

            Poverty, trauma, general pressure from the demands of life, and more can all cause chronic stress.  When you
            have high-stress levels for an extended period of time, you have chronic stress. Long-term stress  like this
            can have a negative impact on your health. It may contribute to:
