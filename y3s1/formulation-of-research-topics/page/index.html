            <strong>
                Introduction
            </strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            Very often, people may want to have a
            <u>
                research topic
            </u>
            <i>
                before
            </i>
            formatting a
            <u>
                research problem.
            </u>

            Yet by the time of thinking how the topic should be, there are


            issues that a researcher feels needs attention to be addressed through research.

        </p>
        <p>
            This means a
            <u>
                problem
            </u>
            should be at hand in order to have research topic which then leads to objectives and questions.
            <br />
            A research topic therefore could be a theme or idea through which all the issues must be evolving from. The
            <b>
                topic
            </b>
            may be referred to as
            <b>
                title
            </b>
            .
        </p>
        <p>

            If you wish to imagine research as a tree it would look like the diagram below.

        </p>
        <p>

            The process of research should flow with every aspect connected.

            <b>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Root
                </b>

                anchors a tree like
                <u>
                    research topic
                </u>
                all the ideas should identify with the  topics. The middle ideas and activities are the stem of the
                tree.



            </li>
            <li>

                The

                <b>
                    stem
                </b>

                connects through branches to leaves and finally fruits.

                    leaves
                </b>

                and

                <b>
                    fruits
                </b>

                are the area equivalent to the conducting of the  research.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Fruits

                are
                <b>
                </b>

                research findings these should be the initial fruit planted, meaning information obtained should have a
                relationship with the topic.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            <u>
                For instance
            </u>
            :
            <i>

            </i>
            .’

        </p>
        <p>

            Research problems are the concerns or  areas identified by a researcher of a situation which needs
            solutions/information  discovery.

            1. Problem Identification:

        </p>
        <p>
            In this stage, researchers identify the potential research problem of “medication errors in a pediatric
            hospital setting” through observations, incident reports, and discussions with healthcare professionals.
            They notice an increase in medication-related incidents, indicating a problem that needs investigation.
        </p>
        <p>

            2. Problem Selection:

            After identifying the problem of “medication errors in a pediatric hospital setting,” researchers must
            decide if this specific problem is worth investigating further. They consider factors like researcher
            interest, research significance, resource availability, and the likelihood of finding a feasible solution.
        </p>
        <p>

            Example:

            Upon careful consideration, the research team finds that medication errors in pediatric care have
            significant implications for patient safety and quality of care. They also recognize that their hospital has
            the necessary resources and support to conduct a thorough study. Therefore, they decide to select this
            problem for further investigation.
        </p>
        <p>

            3. Problem Definition:

            With the problem of “medication errors in a pediatric hospital setting” selected for investigation,
            researchers proceed to define the research topic in more detail. They outline the overall purpose,
            motivation, scope, and expected outcomes of the study.
        </p>
        <p>

            Example:

            The researchers define the research topic as “Understanding the underlying causes of medication errors in a
            pediatric hospital setting and exploring effective strategies to prevent and mitigate these errors.” The
            purpose is to improve patient safety and optimize medication administration practices in the pediatric unit.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this way, the problem formulation steps progress seamlessly from problem identification, where the
            research team identifies the issue of medication errors, to problem selection, where they decide to
            investigate it further, and finally to problem definition, where they outline the specific objectives and
            goals of their research study. Using the same example throughout the process ensures consistency and
            coherence in the research focus.

            <strong>
                Specific (S):
            </strong>
            A good research objective should be clear and focused on a specific aspect or goal of the study. It avoids
            being too broad or vague, so researchers know exactly what they want to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Measurable (M):
            </strong>
            The objective should be measurable, meaning that there should be a way to determine if the research goal has
            been achieved. It’s important to use concrete and quantifiable terms to assess the outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Attainable (A):
            </strong>
            The research objective should be achievable within the resources, time, and scope of the study. It’s
            important to set realistic goals that can be accomplished with the available means.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Realistic (R):
            </strong>
            A good research objective should be grounded in reality and aligned with what is feasible. Researchers
            should consider practical constraints and not set impossible goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Time-Bound (T):
            </strong>
            The objective should have a specific timeframe within which it will be accomplished. Setting a deadline
            helps researchers stay focused and ensures the study progresses effectively.

        <p>
            <strong>

                General objectives

            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                General objectives are broad goals to be achieved

            </li>
            <li>

                The general objectives of the study states what the researcher expects to achieve by the study in
                general terms.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            General objectives are broad and overall goals that the researcher aims to achieve through the study. They
            provide a big-picture view of what the research intends to accomplish. These objectives are not very
            detailed and do not specify the exact actions to be taken. Instead, they outline the general direction and
            purpose of the study.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Example:
            </strong>
            For a nursing research study on patient satisfaction, a general objective could be: “
            <i>
                To assess the factors influencing patient satisfaction in a hospital setting
            </i>
            .”
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                Specific objectives
            </strong>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Specific objectives are short term and narrow in focus.

            </li>
            <li>

                General objectives are broken into small logically connected parts to form specific objectives.

            </li>
            <li>

                The general objective is met through meeting the specific objectives stated.

            </li>
            <li>

                Specific objectives clearly specify what the researcher will do in the study, where and for what purpose
                the study is done.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Specific objectives are more detailed and narrow in focus. They are derived from the general objective and
            break it down into smaller, manageable parts. These objectives clearly state what the researcher will do,
            where the study will take place, and the specific purpose of the study.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Example:
            </strong>
            Continuing from the general objective above, specific objectives could be:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <i>
                    “To conduct patient interviews to gather feedback on their hospital experience.”
                </i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>
                    “To analyze the data from patient surveys to identify common themes affecting satisfaction levels.”
                </i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>
                    “To compare patient satisfaction scores across different hospital departments.”
                </i>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In this example, the specific objectives provide clear directions for data collection and analysis.
            Achieving these specific objectives will contribute to fulfilling the broader, general objective of
            understanding the factors influencing patient satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, general objectives set the overall direction of the research, while specific objectives break down
            the research process into smaller, achievable steps, guiding the researcher in accomplishing the broader
            research goal.

            </li>
            <li>

                The objectives should be clearly phrased in operational terms, specifying exactly what the researcher is
                going to do, where and for what purpose.

        <p>
            In the example provided, the broad objective and specific objective can be identified as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>

                </u>
                :
            </strong>
            The broad objective is the overarching goal of the research study. In this case, the broad objective is: “
            <i>
                To identify risk factors for diarrheal diseases among children below 1 year.
            </i>

                </u>
            </strong>
            Specific objectives are the smaller, more focused goals that contribute to achieving the broad objective. In
            this example, some specific objectives could be:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <i>
                    “To review existing literature on diarrheal diseases in children below 1 year to identify common
                    risk factors.”
                </i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>
                    “To collect data through surveys and interviews from parents or caregivers of children below 1 year
                    to assess their knowledge and practices related to hygiene and sanitation.”

            <li>
                <i>
                    “To analyze the collected data to determine the association between certain risk factors (e.g.,
                    breastfeeding practices, water source, sanitation conditions) and the occurrence of diarrheal
                    diseases in children below 1 year.”
                </i>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In this case, the specific objectives provide clear guidance on the steps the
            er will take to fulfill the broader goal of identifying risk factors for diarrheal diseases among children
            below 1 year. Each specific objective contributes to achieving the overall aim of the study.
