            </li>
            <li>
                The researcher is required to adequately relate the findings to the research objectives.
            </li>
            <li>
                This process involves the presentation of data from the research findings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Usually a research report is presented in a report for as opposed to the proposal writing where we use
                the future tense.

            chart, line graph, histograms etc
            <br />
