            WASTE MANAGEMENT
        </h1>
        <p>

            Waste


            is


            any material – solid, liquid, or gas – that is unwanted and/or unvalued, and has been  discarded or
            discharged by its owner


        </p>
        <p>

            Healthcare Waste


            refers to all


            types of waste from all health care activities


            ; waste generated by the health  care facilities, research facilities and laboratories.

        </p>
        <p>

            Healthcare waste is also known as


            biomedical waste


            ,


            infectious waste


            or


            medical waste



            Healthcare waste is also known as

            <b>
                <i>
                    biomedical waste

            </b>

            , infectious waste or medical waste.

        </p>
        <p>

            The large volumes of health care waste if not managed properly can lead to a global hazard. This could not 
            only lead to the spread of highly contagious diseases but the hazardous chemical waste produced by the use 
            of items can cause considerable damage to the ecosystem and the environment.

            WASTE MANAGEMENT HIERARCHY


        </h4>
        <p>

            Waste management hierarchy


            is a


            structured approach to prioritize and manage waste by minimizing its environmental impact.

        </p>
        <p>

            It consists of several key steps, listed in descending order of priority

        <h4>

        <p>
            Waste management hierarchy

            is defined as the order of preference for action to reduce and manage waste and is usually  presented
            diagrammatically in the form of a pyramid.

        </p>
        <p>

            The aim of waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate a
            minimum amount of waste.

                    Prevention/avoidance:
                </b>

                This concept focuses on the measures to be taken so as not to create any type  of wastes in the first
                place e.g. avoiding to eat from the ward. This is given the top priority in the waste  management
                program.

                According to this concept, the health care setting should reduce  or minimize the amount of waste or the
                toxicity of wastes e.g. avoiding to use gloves in procedures  that don’t necessary need one to use
                gloves and companies should take action to make changes in  the type of materials that are being used
                for the production of the specific products, so as to ensure  that the by-products are of the least
                toxicity.

                Reuse is another effective Solid waste management strategy, in which the waste is not allowed  to enter
                into the disposal system. The wastes are collected in the middle of the production phase and  are again
                fed along with the source to aid in the production process e.g. Autoclaving metal  instruments or
                sterilization of medical equipment.

                    Recycle:

                In the recycling strategy, the waste materials are implemented in the production of a new  product. In
                this process, the waste materials of various forms are collected and then processed. Post  processing,
                they enter into the production lines to give rise to new products. This process prevents  pollution and
                saves energy.

                </b>

                The energy recovery process is also called waste to energy conversion. In this  process; the wastes that
                cannot be recycled are being converted into usable forms of energy such  as heat, light and electricity
                etc. This helps in the saving of various natural resources. Various  processes such as combustion,
                anaerobic digestion, landfill gas recovery, pyrolization and gasification  are being implemented to
                carry out the conversion process.

                is the


                practice of separating different types of waste at the source to ensure proper handling and disposal.

                3. Collection or Handling of Waste:

            </p>
            <p>

                Waste collection


                is the


                systematic gathering of various types of medical waste.

            </p>
            <p>

                Handling


                concerns the


                collection, weighing and storing conditions


            </p>
            <p>

                Trained sanitation personnel, often supervised by nursing staff and sanitation supervisors, manage this
                process. They ensure waste is correctly segregated at the point of generation into appropriate
                color-coded
                bins.

            </p>
            <p>

                Proper documentation is maintained in a register to track waste quantity and type. Regular cleaning and
                disinfection of garbage bins are essential for maintaining hygiene.

            </p>
            <p>

                The waste collection process is conducted in compliance with safety regulations and guidelines, ensuring
                the
                protection of personnel and the environment. This systematic collection is a crucial step in the safe
                and
                efficient management of medical waste.

            </p>
            <p>

                Waste should not be stored in the generation area for more than 4-6 hours. Waste collected in various
                areas
                is prepared for transport or disposal/treatment.

                4. Transportation


                :

            </p>
            <p>

                Hospitals should have a separate corridor and lift dedicated to carrying and transporting waste.

            </p>
            <p>

                General waste is deposited at municipal dumps.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    Waste designated for autoclaving and incineration is disposed of at a separate site for external
                    transport (using distinct colored plastic bags).

                </li>
                <li>

                    Transportation is carried out in sealed containers to prevent leakage.

                </li>

                5. Treatment &amp; Disposal:

            </p>
            <p>

                Waste disposal in hospitals is the final phase in the systematic management of medical waste.

            </p>
            <p>

                It involves the safe and environmentally responsible removal or destruction of waste, ensuring it no
                longer
                poses health risks to patients, staff, and the community.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    General waste is dumped at municipal dumping sites.

                </li>
                <li>

                    The sanitation officer is responsible for coordinating with municipal authorities for proper
                    disposal.

                </li>
                <li>

                    Use of labels/symbols helps in identifying waste for treatment (e.g., Risk of Corrosion, Danger of
                    Infection, Toxic Hazards, Glass Hazards, Radioactive Materials, etc.).
