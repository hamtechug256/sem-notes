                        Teacher-Centered Methods
                    </strong>
                    : In teacher-centered methods, the teacher assumes the role of an expert or authority on the subject
                    matter. Learners are seen as passive recipients of knowledge from the teacher. Examples of such
                    methods include expository or lecture methods, where learners have minimal or no involvement in the
                    teaching process. These methods are often referred to as “closed-ended” due to the limited
                    engagement of learners.

                        Student-Centered Methods:
                    </strong>
                    In student-centered methods, the teacher takes on the role of both a teacher and a learner. The
                    teacher becomes a facilitator and collaborator, while also being open to learning from the students.
                    Lawrence Stenhouse described this approach as one where the teacher’s intellectual horizons are
                    extended rather than constrained in the classroom. Examples of student-centered methods include
                    discussion methods.

                    Curriculum

                : Refers to the broad selected learning areas and how they should be taught  to the learners by the end

        <p>
            Curriculum is determined by the country (MoES for the case of Uganda) but  training institutions or schools
            can modify it by emphasizing or introducing  some learning areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore curriculum means what a learners is supposed to learn by the end of a particular period of study.
            Curriculum determines the quality and  character of the learning product. What we teach determines the
            quantity of  citizens.

            of a particular period of study. When an
            attempt is made to specifically list what should be taught by the end of a  particular period of study the
            syllabus has been made.
        </p>

            The Syllabus is sometimes known as the Course Outline and it is a contract  between the teacher and the

            A Teaching Plan is a step-by-step guide showing how the teaching will be  conducted in a particular session.
            The Teaching Plan must show the: desired  learning outcomes, activities of the teacher and learners in the
            instruction  process and how learning will be measured. A lesson plan guides the teacher  only in a
            particular session or lesson.
