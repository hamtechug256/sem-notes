                Haldan T Mahlar

                of Denmark (who was by then the WHO Director General) proposed the goal of “health for all by the year
                2000”. This was during the World health Organization assembly.
            </li>
            <li>
                The international conference on primary health care took place at

                Alma-Ata

                was the capital of the soviet republic of

                Kazakhstan

                located in the Asiatic region of the Soviet Union (

                Russia

                ). The conference was attended by 300 delegates from 134 governments and 67 international organizations
                from all over the world.

            <li>
                The 3rd world health assembly that took place in

                Geneva

                in

                1979

                endorsed the conference as declaration i.e. the declaration of Alma-Ata (WHO 1978). This declaration
                highlighted a minimum set of activities
                <br />
                considered essential if there were to be implemented. These set of activities were later the components
                of PHC.

            full participation and at the cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of

            Principles of Primary Health Care

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Equitable distribution.

                Man power development

                Community participation.

            <li>
                Self-reliance.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            1.

            <strong>
                Equitable distribution:
            </strong>

            This means that health services must be shared equally by all people irrespective of their social, economic,
            cultural and religious differences. All the people- the rich or poor, the urban or rural must have access to
            health services. So this principle is to address the imbalance currently in health care by distributing the
            health care budget to rural areas other than concentrating the budget only in cities.
            <br>
            2.
            <strong>

                Manpower development:

            </strong>
            Primary health care aims at mobilizing the human potential of the entire country by making use of available
            resources. This ensures that there is availability of adequate number of appropriate health personnel
            required to devise and implement plan and action. The strategies required
            <br />
            would be re-orientation of the existing health workers development of new categories of workers in health,
            motivation and training of all manpower to serve the community.
            <br />
            3.

            <strong>
                Community participation:
            </strong>

            This is a process by which individuals, families and communities assume responsibility in promoting their
            own health and welfare. To promote the development of the community and community’s self-reliance, residents
            themselves need to participate in decisions about their health in
            <br />
            the community. Community members and health workers/providers need to work together in partnership to seek
            solutions to the complex problems facing communities today.
            <br />
            4.

            <strong>
                Appropriate technology
            </strong>

            : Is technology that is sound scientifically, flexible and adaptable to the community’s local needs,
            acceptable to those who use it and to it is used to (served), and it can be maintained by the community
            people themselves in keeping with the principle of self-reliance, using the resources the community has and
            can afford. Refers to health care that is relevant to people’s health needs and concerns as well as being
            acceptable to them. It includes issues of costs and affordability of services within the context of existing
            resources i.e. the number and type of health professionals’ equipment, and their pattern of distribution
            throughout the community. Appropriate technology means a technology which requires low capital investment,
            conserves natural resources, is managed by its users and is in harmony with the environment.
            <br />
            5.

            <strong>
                Multisectoral approach:
            </strong>

            Health and family welfare programs cannot stand on their own in an isolated manner. It is recognized that
            the health of a community cannot be improved within just the health sector; other sectors are equally
            important in promoting the community’s health and self-reliance, These sectors
            <br />
            include, agriculture, animal husbandry, education, housing, public works, communication, water, environment,
            rural development, cooperatives, industries etc. These sectors need to work together in a multi-sectoral
            partnership to coordinate their goals, plans and activities to ensure that they contribute to
            <br />
            the health of the community and to avoid conflicting or duplicity efforts.
            <br />
            6.

            <strong>
                Self-reliance:
            </strong>

            this principle self-reliance applies at the three client level of individual family and community.
            <br />
            PHC practitioners play a major role in helping people achieve self-reliance in relation to their health care
            through community participation and involvement. This means the individuals, families and or communities are
            encouraged to change the attitude of being passive recipients to active partners with or without government
            or donor support.

            <li>

                <strong>
                    Community participation
                </strong>

                ; this is very important for PHC programs to be socially acceptable and sustainable. Community
                participation is a process whereby the individuals and families assume  responsibility for their own
