                    Bereavement

            The experience of someone who is grieved or bereaved is entirely individual. The way a person grieves
            depends on a number of factors such as one’s personality and coping style, life experience, faith, and the
            nature of the loss grieving process takes time.

            <strong>
                Grief
            </strong>
            is the emotional and psychological experience activated by loss of something dear.

        <p>

            Grief is a natural response to loss. It is the emotional suffering you feel when something or someone you
            love is taken away. It is felt by an individual, family or community brought about by loss; most intensely
            with the death of a loved one (HAU, 2011).

                    </strong>
                    The nature of the relationship you had with the person who passed away can affect the intensity and
                    duration of grief. Having a close and positive relationship can make it harder to let go compared to
                    a difficult or distant relationship.

                    : The circumstances surrounding the death can impact the grieving process. Factors such as whether
                    the death was due to natural causes, accident, suicide, or homicide, as well as whether it occurred
                    close to or far from home, can influence the grieving experience.

                    </strong>
                    : The social context surrounding the loss can play a role in the grieving process. If the loss is
                    socially stigmatized or not openly acknowledged, such as in the case of AIDS or suicide, it can add
                    additional challenges to the grieving individual. Lack of social support can also make the grieving
                    process more difficult.

                    </strong>

                    acknowledged or recognized by society. This lack of validation can make the grieving process more
                    complicated for individuals in these groups.
