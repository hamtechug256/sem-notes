            ADVANCE DIRECTIVES IN PALLIATIVE CARE


        </h2>
        <p>
            An advance directive, also known as an Advance Directive, is a
            <i>
                legal document
            </i>
            that upholds the principle of autonomy by expressing a patient’s desires regarding medical treatments when
            they are unable to make decisions themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Advance directives serve as essential tools for documenting end-of-life patients’ wishes when they are no
            longer able to make decisions about their medical care. In palliative care, the two most common types of
            advance directives are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Living will

        </ol>
        <h3>
                Living Will
        </h3>
        <p>
            A living will is a legally binding document that allows individuals to maintain control over their
            healthcare decisions in the event that they become incapable of making choices on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
            It specifically applies to situations where the person has a terminal illness with no possibility of cure or
            is in a permanent unconscious state, often referred to as a “
            <i>

            </i>
            .”
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of a living will is to outline the types of medical treatments the person would or would not
            want in these circumstances, including decisions regarding life-prolonging measures such as dialysis, tube
            feedings, or artificial life support like breathing machines.
        </p>
        <p>
            This document must be written and signed by the patient, and it usually requires witnesses who are not
            spouses, potential heirs, the patient’s doctors, or employees of the patient’s healthcare facility.

                Understanding that choosing not to pursue aggressive medical treatment is distinct from refusing all
                forms of medical care. Other forms of treatment, such as pain medication and antibiotics, can still be
                administered to ensure comfort, shifting the treatment goal from cure to comfort. It is crucial to
                clearly express specific preferences and wishes in the living will.

        </ol>

            Note: The client has the right to revoke or amend a living will at any time according to their wishes.

        <p>
            A durable power of attorney for health care, also known as a health care power of attorney, is a legal
            document that enables the client to appoint a trusted person as their proxy or agent to make health care
            decisions on their behalf in the event that they become unable to do so.
        </p>
        <h4>

        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The appointed proxy or agent has the authority to communicate with doctors and caregivers and make
                decisions based on the client’s previously expressed directions.
            </li>
            <li>
                The chosen proxy determines the treatments or procedures that the client would want or not want. If the
                client’s wishes are unknown in a particular situation, the agent will make decisions based on what they
                believe the client would choose.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is essential to select a person as the proxy whom the client trusts to carry out their wishes,
                especially in times of stress, uncertainty, and sadness.
            </li>
            <li>
                The client should have open discussions with their chosen proxy, ensuring they are comfortable with the
                role and discussing their wishes in detail.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is advisable to designate an alternate person in case the primary proxy becomes unable or unwilling
                to fulfill their role. The law generally prohibits health care providers, such as doctors, nurses, or
                other caregivers, from serving as agents unless they are close relatives.

                Has the authority to make health care decisions on behalf of the client only when the attending doctor
                certifies the client as incapable of making their own decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Must make health care decisions on behalf of the client if the client has not documented their health
                care directives, even in end-of-life situations.
            </li>
            <li>

                Medical Service (EMS) teams and allows patients to refuse full resuscitation efforts in advance, even if

            carried with the patient and is applicable in various healthcare settings. Emergency personnel, such as
            paramedics and emergency room doctors, are obligated to follow these orders. Without a POLST form, emergency

            If a woman is of childbearing age, it is important for her to clearly state her decisions regarding

            these decisions depends on factors such as the risks to both the mother and the fetus, the stage of
            pregnancy, and the policies of the doctors and healthcare facilities involved. Generally, if a woman is in
            the second or third trimester of pregnancy, doctors will provide necessary medical care to preserve the

            <li>
                Advance directives provide a simple and clear way for clients to express their wishes in case they
                become incapacitated and unable to communicate.
            </li>
            <li>
                These directives allow clients to appoint a trusted person, such as a family member or close friend, to
                make decisions on their behalf when they are unable to do so or in specific circumstances they have
                designated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating an advance directive helps alleviate the stress for both family members and healthcare
                professionals before a serious injury or illness occurs.
            </li>
            <li>
                By using an advance directive, the course of medical treatment can be guided effectively throughout the
                patient’s hospice care.
            </li>
            <li>
                Through an advance directive, patients can communicate their preferences and choices to healthcare
                providers while they are still able to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
                Having an advance directive helps ensure that the patient can avoid unnecessary pain by clearly stating
                their wishes regarding medical procedures.
            </li>
            <li>
                It also helps the patient avoid unwanted hospitalization by providing instructions on preferred
                locations for end-of-life care, such as hospice or home.
