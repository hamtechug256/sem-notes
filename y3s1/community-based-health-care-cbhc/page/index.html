            Introduction to Community Based Health Care (CBHC)
        </h1>
        <blockquote>
            CBHC is the program on health care in which community members are actively involved in the identification,
            prioritization of their own health needs and in mobilization of their own resources to meet those needs.

        <h3>

            Introduction

        </h3>
        <p>
            Community Based Health Care (CBHC) is part of Primary Health Care (PHC) while more concerned with people.
            <br />
            CBHC is viewed in the context that when giving care to patients, you must put in mind that client needs
            continuous care even when you have left. It shows that community participation is very important and doesn’t
            <br />
            work in isolation when giving care, involve them in plan so that they take responsibility. Since most of
            resources come from the community like food and other materials. It will be simple if you can teach them how
            to make
            <br />
            use of them in the care.
        </p>
        <h4>

            The need for PHC and CBHC arises from the following.

        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Most illnesses can be prevented
                </strong>
                : the most common illnesses are preventable or controllable, either by the people themselves or a
                combined effort between the people and government or other partner
                <br />
                (NGO) services e.g. malaria.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Morbidity and Mortality rates can be reduced
                </strong>
                : a reduction in this suffering can only happen if there is more “encouragement” and “enablement” of
                individuals and communities together to have a positive attitude towards preventive habits and to be
                willing to take part in improving their local amenities, rather than expecting the people to go to the
                health services and development projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                The encouraging and enabling cannot go on within the walls of the hospitals and health centers; it must
                go on in the villages and homes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Coverage of health services:
                </strong>
                even if there was full service in the health units, there are still few e.g. dental and mental services
                and they are mainly located in towns and rural population have little access to essential health care.
            </li>
        </ol>
