            Acute pain can be anticipatory, procedural, acute-on-chronic, or breakthrough pain. It is often associated

            Spinal Cord Compression


        </h4>
        <blockquote>
            Spinal cord compression (SCC) is an emergency condition where the spinal cord is compressed, leading to
            neurological symptoms.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The most common cause of SCC is vertebral metastases invading the epidural space and compressing the spinal
            cord. It is frequently observed in advanced carcinoma, particularly in breast, lung, prostate, kidney,
            lymphoma, myeloma, and sarcoma cancers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 20% of cases, compression of the cord occurs at more than one level. The commonest site for compression
            is in the thoracic spine (70%), followed by the lumbar spine (20%), and cervical spine (10%). Below the
            level of L2 compression is the CAUDA EQUINA not the spinal cord.
        </p>
        <p>

                Presentation
            </strong>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                SCC usually presents with back pain (&lt;90%). Typically pain is the earliest sign. It may be a bony
                pain due to vertebral metastases, radicular or nerve root compression, a diffuse band-like pain, or an
                unpleasant sensation below the level of compression. Pain is often exacerbated by straining, coughing,
                or sneezing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sensation of sharp shooting pains, electric shock-like sensations down the legs may also indicate spinal
                cord compression. Pain can usually be elicited by percussion of the vertebra within one or two vertebrae
                of the compression, but absence of tenderness in the presence of suggestive history doesn’t rule out the
                diagnosis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Escalating back pains (i.e. increasing in severity rapidly) that is difficult to relieve should always
                raise high suspicion of SCC.
            </li>
            <li>
                Following escalating back pain, weakness of the limbs tends to occur in continuing SCC. Patients often
                initially describe their legs as HEAVY or uncoordinated. A history of escalating back pain and heavy
                legs is sufficient to consider treating for SCC.

                Urgent treatment may require high dose steroids. Dexamethasone 16-24 mgs oral or IV, this will reduce
                the inflammation around the tumor (peri tumor edema) and the spinal cord and may improve leg weakness

                Titrate analgesia and if on, morphine, the dose is likely to need a substantial increase in the early
                stages of SCC, it should happen at the same time as using steroids and RT.

                Particular attention should be paid to incontinence, bowel care, and pressure areas. Patients with urine
                retention will require catheterization.

                Those with complete cord compression unresponsive to treatment and compression are likely to require
                enemas or manual evacuation of the rectum regularly.

            <li>
                Helping the patient to sit up for periods and regular changing of position will prevent pressure
                sores/areas.

                Family members should be taught to care for their relative in this way.

                Advising both the patient and family about SCC and its effect, including a realistic assessment of the
                prospect of recovery, is very important.
            </li>
            <li>
                In practice, recovery will usually occur early if it is going to do so, i.e. Improvement in condition
                occurring within days/weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
                After weeks of immobility, recovery is increasingly unlikely, and a difficult prospect for anybody to
                face, it is kinder to be truthful with the patient at this stage than to suggest future recovery.
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating false hope, even when well-intended, is unfair to the patient and it often leads to huge
                efforts, expense (often paying for expensive physiotherapy, urging patients to try harder, etc.) and
                ultimately to huge frustration and disappointment when there is no improvement, despite all their
                efforts and promises. This may damage the relationship between you and the patient if he/she realizes
                hasn’t been told the truth.
