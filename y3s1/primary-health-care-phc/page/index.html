            PRIMARY HEALTH CARE (PHC) INTRODUCTION

            <em>
                BACK GROUND AND FACTS ON PHC
            </em>

        </p>
        In 1978 world leaders, international organizations and health authorities (WHO &amp;

        UNICEF gathered in
        <b>
            Alma-Ata
        </b>
        (Almaty), Kazakhstan, and released the
        <b>
            Declaration of
        </b>


        <b>
            Alma-Ata
        </b>
        on Primary Health Care, which remains a landmark document in the history of


        global health. This was to get way forward to the health problems faced by people of the


        whole world.

        <br />

        <br />

        The
        <b>
            Alma-Ata Declaration
        </b>
        established a standard of public commitment to making

        community-driven, quality health care accessible, both physically and financially, for all.

        134 governments ratified the WHO Declaration of Alma-Ata, asserting that:
        (a) Health for all could be achieved by 2000.
        (b) Governments have a responsibility for the health of their people that can be fulfilled only by
        the provision of adequate health and social measures.
        (c) Primary health care is the key to attaining a level of health that will permit their citizens to

        lead a socially and economically productive life.

        The Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978 emerged as a major milestone of the 20th

        century in the field of public health and it identified Primary Health Care (PHC) as the


        key to the attainment of the goal of
        <b>
            Health for All
        </b>
        (
        <b>
            HFA
        </b>
        ).

        <br />

        <br />

        <b>
            HFA
        </b>
        is defined as “the attainment by all peoples of the world by a particular date (kept

        at that time as the year 2000), of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially


        and economically productive life”.
