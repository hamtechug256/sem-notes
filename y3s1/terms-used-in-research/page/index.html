            is the dependent variable.

        <p>
            Pretesting is the stage in research when tools/data collection instruments like the questionnaires are
            tested on members of the target population. Pre-testing is the administration of the data collection
            instrument with a small set of respondents from the population for the full-scale research. If problems
            occur in the pre-test, it is likely that similar problems will arise in full-scale administration.

        <ul>
            <li>

                The purpose of pre-testing is to identify problems with the data collection instrument and find possible
                solutions.

            </li>
            <li>

                Pretesting ensures the data collections tools are valid hence generation of reliable results

            </li>
            <li>

                Pre-testing also helps assess whether respondents are able and willing to provide the needed information

            </li>
            <li>

                Pre-testing allows the responsible assessor to test solutions to problems with the questionnaire.

                Pre-testing should be conducted in circumstances that are as similar as possible to actual data

            </li>
            <li>

                Pre-testing should be conducted on population members as similar as possible to those that will be
                sampled.

            </li>
            <li>

                Careful notes should be taken on the problems encountered and possible solutions should be identified.

        <p>
            A pilot study is a smaller version of a proposed study conducted to refine the methodology. It is developed
            much like the proposed study, using similar subjects, the same settings, the same treatment, the same data
            collection, and analysis techniques. A study carried out at the end of the planning phase of research to
            explore and test the research elements to make relevant modifications in research tools and methodology. It
            is aimed at testing the data instruments to ascertain its feasibility in the actual conduct of the research.

            The process of learning the key facts about a clinical trial before deciding whether or not to participate.
            It is also a continuing process throughout the study to provide information for participants. To help
