            SPIRITUALITY IN PALLIATIVE CARE
        </h1>

        <p>

            Spirituality is defined as a way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they
            experience their  connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or
            sacred.

        </p>
        <p>

            Spirituality means different things to different people. Religion and faith might be part of someone’s 
            spirituality, but spirituality isn’t always religious.

        </p>
        <p>

            Everyone has spiritual needs throughout their lives whether they follow a religion or not.

            <b>

                Spiritual distress
            </b>

            – also called spiritual pain or suffering – can occur when people are unable to find sources  of meaning,
            hope, love, peace, comfort, strength and connection in their life.


            This distress can also affect their physical and mental health. Terminal illness can often cause spiritual
            distress  in patients as well as their family and friends.

                becoming more withdrawn and isolated, afraid  of being alone, refusing care saying they feel scared or

            Personal awareness


        </h2>
        <p>
            Personal awareness is the ability to know and understand oneself, including one’s values, beliefs,
            strengths, weaknesses, and emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is an important skill for anyone who provides palliative care, as it allows us to be more sensitive to
            the needs of our patients and their families.

            <li>
                <strong>
                    We are more in charge of our lives.
                </strong>
                When we know ourselves well, we are better able to make decisions that are in our best interests. This
                is especially important when we are providing care to others, as we need to be able to set boundaries
                and take care of ourselves.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    We develop greater sensitivity to our own feelings and to those of others.
                </strong>
                When we are aware of our own emotions, we are better able to understand and respond to the emotions of
                others. This is essential in palliative care, as we are often dealing with people who are experiencing a
                wide range of emotions, such as grief, fear, and anger.

            <li>

                    Reflecting on our own experiences in life can help us to help others.
                </strong>
                When we reflect on our own experiences, we can gain insights that can help us to understand the
                experiences of others. This can be especially helpful when we are working with people who are facing
                challenges that we have faced ourselves.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    We are better able to resolve our own problems or life issues, if we know ourselves well.
                </strong>
                When we know ourselves well, we are better able to identify and address our own problems. This can help
                us to be more effective in our work, as we will be less likely to be distracted by our own personal
                issues.
