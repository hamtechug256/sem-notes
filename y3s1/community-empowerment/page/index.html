                Community empowerment
            </b>
            refers to the process of enabling communities to increase control over their lives and the decisions that
            affect them.
        </p>
        <p>
            It involves measures and actions designed to enhance autonomy, self-determination, and the ability of

        </p>
        <p>
            It is about increasing their assets, attributes, and capacities to access resources, build partnerships,
            establish networks, and have a voice in order to exert control. The concept of empowerment emphasizes that
            individuals and communities are the agents of their own empowerment, and external agents can only catalyze
            or facilitate the process.

            ownership and action that explicitly aims at social and political change. It’s a process of renegotiating
            power in order to gain more control. It recognizes that if some people are going  to be empowered then
            others will be sharing their existing power and giving some of it up.
