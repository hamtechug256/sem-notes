            Hemorrhage
        </h1>

        <p>
            Hemorrhage, or profuse bleeding, can occur from major blood vessels and can be a frightening event for
            patients and their caregivers.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, hemorrhage is often predictable and requires proactive management, such as ensuring necessary
            medicines are available in the home care setting for emergencies.
        </p>
        <h4>


            Causes of Hemorrhage.


        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>

                    Catastrophic bleeding from tumor erosion

                    : Hemorrhage can occur when tumors erode into nearby blood vessels, especially in areas such as the
                    head and neck, stomach, pelvis, bladder, or lungs. Tumors infiltrating blood vessels can lead to
                    significant bleeding.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                    Bleeding from oesophageal varices in cirrhosis

                    : Patients with advanced liver disease, particularly cirrhosis, may develop oesophageal varices.
                    These are enlarged veins in the esophagus that can rupture and cause torrential bleeding.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                    Blood-clotting disorders:

                    Palliative patients may have underlying bleeding disorders, such as abnormalities in platelet number
                    and function or reduced clotting factors. These conditions can impair the blood’s ability to clot
                    properly and increase the risk of hemorrhage.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                    Low platelet levels in malignancies and HIV

                    : Certain malignancies, such as bone marrow infiltration by cancer cells, can result in decreased
                    platelet production or destruction, leading to low platelet levels (thrombocytopenia). HIV infection
                    can also cause thrombocytopenia, further increasing the risk of bleeding.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>


            Assessment and management of hemorrhage in palliative care patients


        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The first rule of management is to ensure that the patient is never left alone until the bleeding is
                under control. Immediate attention and support are crucial during a hemorrhagic episode.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there is a risk of bleeding, anticoagulants such as warfarin should be either stopped or maintained
                at the lowest effective doses to minimize the potential for excessive bleeding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Review and reassess other medications that could contribute to bleeding. If these medications are not
                essential for symptom control, they should be discontinued to reduce the risk of hemorrhage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider referring the patient for radiotherapy in specific cases:
                <br />
                <b>
                    a
                </b>
                . Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) from lung tumors.
                <br />
                <b>
                    b
                </b>
                . Bleeding from Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and fungating tumors.
                <br />
                <b>
                    c
                </b>
                . Bleeding from head and neck tumors.
                <br />
                <b>
                    d
                </b>
                . Hematuria (blood in urine) due to bladder cancer.
                <br />
                <b>
                    e
                </b>
                . Rapidly growing erosive tumors.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the patient has a history of smaller bleeds, consider administering tranexamic acid in a dose of
                0.5mg to 1g, given two to three times a day (bd/tds), if it is available. Tranexamic acid helps in
                reducing bleeding.
            </li>
            <li>
                For surface bleeding from tumor areas, the use of gauze soaked in adrenaline (1ml) or crushed tranexamic
                acid applied topically can be considered to control bleeding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Isolated bleeding vessels may be amenable to surgical ligation, which involves tying off or closing the
                bleeding blood vessels surgically.
            </li>
            <li>
                In severe cases where hemorrhage may lead to a terminal event, various measures can be implemented:
                <br />
                <b>
                    a
                </b>
                . Keep dark towels nearby for the family, as blood can appear to be of a much larger volume on white or
                pale surfaces. This helps manage the emotional impact of the bleeding event.
                <br />
                <b>
                    b
                </b>
                . Sedation with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (10 mg orally or rectally), may be administered to
                alleviate anxiety and fear during catastrophic bleeding events. However, it is essential to note that
                the rapid progression of bleeding may limit the effectiveness of sedation.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>


            For Children


        </h5>
        <p>
            When managing hemorrhage in children, particularly those with hematological malignancies, the following
            approaches should be considered:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Aim for rapid and complete sedation using benzodiazepines and/or opioids, if available, administered
                    through parenteral routes. This helps ensure the child remains calm and comfortable during the
                    episode.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If the child is able to swallow, administer double the usual dose of morphine, with or without
                    diazepam, as prescribed. This helps manage pain and anxiety associated with severe nose bleeds
                    (epistaxis).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In cases where the child is unable to swallow, administer large doses of morphine and diazepam
                    rectally. The recommended rectal valium dose is as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the child’s weight is unknown: 5mg for children below 3 years, and up to 10mg for children
                        older than 3 years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the child’s weight is known: Administer a dose of 0.5–1mg/kg up to a maximum of 10kg.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>


            Superior Vena Cava Obstruction (SVCO)


        </h2>
        <blockquote>
            SVCO refers to the partial or complete blockage of blood flow through the superior vena cava, leading to
            impaired venous return into the right atrium.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is a condition where the superior vena cava, which carries blood from the
            head, neck, and upper thorax to the right atrium, becomes obstructed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This obstruction can be caused by external compression from a tumor or lymph node, direct invasion of the
            vessel wall by a tumor, or thrombosis of the vein due to a blood clot. When the vein is obstructed, it
            impairs blood flow to the right atrium and the upper drainage above the thorax.
        </p>
        <p>
            SVCS is most commonly seen in lung cancers, particularly small cell carcinoma, accounting for about 75% of
            cases. Lymphoma accounts for about 15% of cases, and other cancers such as breast, colon, esophagus, and
            testicular cancer can also cause SVCS. If left untreated, SVCS can progress rapidly, leading to
            complications such as thrombosis, cerebral edema, and even death within a few days. The respiratory,
            cardiac, and central nervous systems are always affected by this condition.
        </p>
