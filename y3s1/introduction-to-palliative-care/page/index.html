        </h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and families
                facing the problem associated with life threating illness through the prevention and relief of
                suffering by means of early identification and assessment and treatment of pain and other
                problems which are physical , psychological and spiritual.

        <p>
            Palliative care aims at achieving physical symptom relief but also extends far beyond it. It seeks to
            integrate physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects of care so that patients may come to terms
            with their impending death as fully and constructively as they can.

            an oxford trained nurse noted the

            Initially Hospice was reserved for those with

                inpatient care

            Principles of Palliative Care

        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>

                <strong>
                    Patient centered
                </strong>

                : Palliative care revolves around the patient and their family. The focus is on maintaining hope with
                realistic goals, supporting the patient and their loved ones throughout different stages of the illness.
                Sustain hope with realistic goals in order to help patient and families cope in appropriate way through
                the different phase of the illness.
            </li>
            <li>

                <strong>
                    Appropriate ethical consideration:
                </strong>

                There are many ethical issues that arise in care of all patients. Seek to do good or do no harm,
                patients’ rights must be considered to decide fairly. Palliative care involves navigating various
                ethical issues. Remember to balance doing what’s best for the patient while respecting their rights and
                autonomy.
            </li>
            <li>

                <strong>
                    Continuum of treatment
                </strong>

                . This involves management of pain and other symptoms i.e. Palliative care begins from the time of
                diagnosis and extends beyond the patient’s passing. It includes pain and symptom management as well as
                providing bereavement care for the family after death. (bereavement
                <br />
                care).
            </li>
            <li>

                <strong>
                    Teamwork and partnership
                </strong>

                : Palliative care requires an interdisciplinary team to address the diverse needs of patients
                effectively. It is not easy to address all patients’ needs alone. An interdisciplinary team should be
                established to deal with all the problems. i.e. no single profession can address all issues that cause
                total pain. Team members share challenges facing the patient and plan effective management of the
                patient using their skill mix. A palliative care team includes:

                        Holistic care approach:
                    </strong>


                    Holistic care treats the patients as a whole person, not just as a medical case. This approach
                    focuses not only on physical care, but also psychological (emotional), social and spiritual care.
                    This psychological and emotional support and care should be available for the caregivers as well as
                    the patient, family members, community volunteers, professional care and support workers (health
                    workers, counselors, social workers), before, during and after periods of care giving.

                <strong>
                    Physical care:
                </strong>
                This involves the assessment and management of pain and other physical symptoms. Its important because

                <strong>
                    Psychological care:
                </strong>
                Effective communication skills are crucial in caring for patients holistically. Providing emotional
                support, active listening, and compassionate understanding help patients cope with the emotional
                challenges they face.

                    Spiritual care
                </strong>
                : This is important to terminally ill and it includes allowing patients to express their spirituality,
                praying with them if they request for arranging for an appropriate leader to visit them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Family support:
                </strong>
                The terminal phase of illness is often very difficult for patients’ family. Support therefore needs to
                be offered to the family. It includes spending time, listening and giving support to them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Social care
                </strong>
                : This incorporates discussion of social and family issue e.g. This could include considering the
                well-being of young children who may become orphans and discussing financial matters that can impact the
                patient and their family.

                <strong>
                    Health facilities based:
                </strong>
                Palliative care is provided either in hospital at the outpatient department or in other clinics as
                designated by the in-charge. Health Centers IV and Ill with palliative care trained

                <strong>
                    Health facility Out-reach programs:
                </strong>
                specialist palliative care health workers travel to other center to provide palliative care. Palliative
                care in this modal is provided by palliative care trained health workers. The team moves to the
                community to provide palliative care services closer to the community. Facility outreach programs are
                important in that they bring the services nearer to the
                <br />
                people. Hence patients do not have to walk long distances and a mass of people can be seen within their
                villages.

                    Roadside clinics/stopovers:
                </strong>
                This is a model of care that enables patients who live far away from health facilities to access
                palliative care. Health care providers plan with patients and their caregivers to
                <br />
                meet- in identified place along the route or on their way to an outreach. They make a stopover in an
                agreed place. The place location can be a trading Centre, under a tree, at a particular signpost or at a
                school.

                <strong>
                    Facility day care:
                </strong>
                This is when a day is set aside for the patient and their caretaker to spend time with other patients in
                at the facility. This facility could be a hospital, health Centre a hospice. This activity
                <br />
                enables recreation as well as socialization. Patients get to share their challenges encounter during the
                disease trajectory arid even counsel themselves. They interact as they enjoy lunch or tea, they also get
                an opportunity to see their nurses or doctors at the site and have they needs attended to.

            Challenges for implementing palliative care

        </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Perception and recognition
                </strong>
                : many people still fear palliative care because they link it to death and many do not want to admit
                that they are dying. It is also common with health worker, policy makers
                <br />
                and others.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Policy development;
                </strong>
                sustainable, affordable and effective palliative care must be an integral of a country’s health system.
                To achieve this there must be coordination with all health sectors. Some
                <br />
                policies prohibit use of oral opioids, so advocacy for change is important
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Education:
                </strong>
                health providers and community members need to be educated on diagnosis, classification and application
                of holistic approach. Training should be in medical/nursing schools
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Drug availability:
                </strong>
                there are limited recourses including limited drug budget a palliative drugs are given priority because
                they are for symptoms relief. It is important for these drugs to be included in the
                <br />
                essential drug list.
