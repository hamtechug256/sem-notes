            Sample size determination


            , also known as sample size calculation or sample size estimation, is the process of determining the number
            of individuals or items to be included in a sample from a larger population for a research study.

            HOW TO DETERMINE SAMPLE SIZE

        </h4>
        <p>

            1.


            Census (for Small Populations):

        </p>
        <p>

            A


            census


            involves including every member of the population in your sample. This method is highly advantageous for
            small populations because it


            eliminates


            sampling


            errors


            and provides data on every individual in the population.

        </p>
        <p>

            NOTE


            : census is only feasible for small populations. Conducting a census for large populations may not be
            cost-effective and practical.

            2.


            Transfer from a Similar Study:

        </p>
        <p>

            Another approach is to


            transfer


            the sample size from a


            similar study


            with comparable objectives and characteristics. This strategy can save time and resources.

        </p>
        <p>

            A potential disadvantage is that you might repeat the mistakes made in the previous study. Ensure the
            previous study was methodologically sound.

        </p>
        <p>

            3.


            Using Internet Sample Size Calculators:


            This method utilizes the Internet sites that help one to determine the sample.

        </p>
        <p>

            One Examples is:

            4.



            Utilizing Published Tables:


        </p>
        <p>

            Researchers can make use of published tables designed for sample size determination. One such example is the


            Krejcie &amp; Morgan table of 1970,


            which helps researchers determine the sample size for a given population. Another example is Glenn(1992).

        </p>
        <p>







            <br />

        </p>


        WHERE


        :

        <ul>
            <li>

                N


                is the


                Population

            </li>
            <li>

                S


                is the


                Sample size


                you need to draw.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            For example


            a For a population of


            45


            people, Krejcie &amp; Morgan table advises a Sample of


            40


            people.

        </p>
        <p>

            For


            10


            people, Sample is


            10


            , requiring a


            Census


            due to the small number of people.

        </p>
        <p>

            These tables are a valuable resource and provide guidance on sample size selection, taking into account
            factors like population size, confidence levels, and error margins.

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            Using Kish and Leslie Formula:

            n = Z¬≤pq / d¬≤

            <li>

                n = Sample size

            </li>
            <li>

                Z = Z-score for the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence)

            </li>
            <li>

                p = Assumed true population prevalence of diabetic patients

            </li>
            <li>

                q = Complement of p (1-p)

            </li>
            <li>

                d = Margin of Error (0.05)

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            n = (1.96)¬≤ X 0.40 X (1 ‚Äì 0.40) / (0.05)¬≤

            n ‚âà


            346.18

        </p>
        <p>

            In this scenario, you would need a sample size of approximately 347 diabetic patients attending Goma Health
            Center in Mukono District to estimate the true population prevalence with a 95% confidence level and a 5%
            margin of error.

            n ‚âà


            333.33

        </p>
        <p>

            In this scenario, you would need a sample size of approximately 333 diabetic patients attending Goma Health
            Center in Mukono District to achieve the desired level of precision (5%).
