            PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
        </h1>


        <p>

            Personal protective equipment – known as ‘

            <b>
                PPE’
            </b>

            – is used to protect health care workers while  performing specific tasks that might involve them coming
            into contact with blood or body fluids that may  contain some infectious agents (germs).

        </p>
        <p>

            Personal protective equipment is special equipment you wear to create a barrier between you and germs.  This
            barrier reduces the chance of touching, being exposed to, and spreading germs. Personal protective equipment
            (PPE) helps prevent the spread of germs in the hospital. This can protect  people and health care workers
            from infections.

        </p>
        <p>

            It includes many of the items often associated with health care by the public – gowns, gloves and masks. 
            These items will be for single use only – that is, you MUST use them once and then discard them – while 
            others are retained, cleaned and reused.

        </p>
        <p>

            All hospital staff, patients, and visitors should use PPE when there will be contact with blood or other
            bodily  fluids.

            Definition


            : A surgical mask is a loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the  mouth
            and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment. These are sometimes referred
            to as face masks, as described above, although not all face masks are regulated  as surgical masks.

        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                Note
            </b>

            :

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Surgical masks are made in different thicknesses and with different ability to protect you from contact 
                with liquids.

            </li>
            <li>

                These properties may also affect how easily you can breathe through the face mask and how well the 
                surgical mask protects you.

            </li>
            <li>

                Surgical masks are not intended to be used more than once.

            </li>
            <li>

                Surgical masks are not to be shared and may be labeled as surgical, isolation, dental, or medical 
                procedure masks.

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            While a surgical mask may be effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets, a face mask, by 
            design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs,
            sneezes,  or certain medical procedures.

            A respirator is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very
            efficient  filtration of airborne particles.

        </p>
        <p>

            Note that the edges of the respirator are designed to form a seal around the nose and mouth.

                N95 (commonly used in Uganda)

            <li>

                KN95

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                People with chronic respiratory, cardiac, or other medical conditions that make breathing difficult 
                should check with their health care provider before using an N95 respirator because the N95  respirator
                can make it more difficult for the wearer to breathe.

            </li>
            <li>

                Some models have exhalation valves that can make breathing out easier and help reduce heat build up.
                Note that N95 respirators with exhalation valves should not be used when sterile conditions are  needed.

            </li>
            <li>

                All respirators are labeled as “single-use,” disposable devices. If your respirator is damaged or
                soiled,  or if breathing becomes difficult, you should remove the respirator, discard it properly, and
                replace it  with a new one. To safely discard your N95 respirator, place it in a plastic bag and put it
                in the trash.  Wash your hands after handling the used respirator.

            </li>
            <li>

                N95 respirators are not designed for children or people with facial hair. Because a proper fit cannot 
                be achieved on children and people with facial hair, the N95 respirator may not provide full 
                protection.

                most widely used type of fire extinguisher is the multipurpose  dry chemical that is effective on Class
                A, B, and C fires. This agent also works by creating a barrier  between the oxygen element and the fuel
                element on Class A fires.

                Fire extinguishers can be heavy, so it’s a good idea to practice picking up and holding an extinguisher 
                to get an idea of the weight and feel.

            </li>
            <li>

                Take time to read the operating instructions and warnings found on the fire extinguisher label. Not  all
                fire extinguishers look alike.

            </li>
            <li>

                Practice releasing the discharge hose or horn and aiming it at the base of an imagined fire. Do not
                pull  the pin or squeeze the lever. This will break the extinguisher seal and cause it to lose pressure

            </li>

                (d). Starting at the recommended distance, Sweep the nozzle of hose from side to side until the fire is 
                out. Move forward or around the fire area as the fire diminishes. Watch the area in case of re ignition.

            In addition, fire extinguishers must be maintained annually in accordance with local, state, and national
            codes  and regulations. This is a thorough examination of the fire extinguisher’s mechanical parts, fire
            extinguishing  agent, and the expellent gas.

        </p>
        <p>

            Your fire equipment professional is the ideal person to perform the annual maintenance because they have 
            the appropriate servicing manuals, tools, recharge materials, parts, lubricants, and the necessary training
            and  experience.

            Like any mechanical device, fire extinguishers must be maintained on a regular basis to ensure their proper
            operation. You, the owner or occupant of the property where the fire extinguishers are located, are 
            responsible for arranging your fire extinguishers’ maintenance.

        </p>
        <p>

            Fire extinguishers must be inspected or given a “quick check” every 30 days.

        </p>
        <p>

            For most extinguishers, this is a job that you can easily do by locating the extinguishers in your
            workplace  and answering the three questions below.

                Does the gauge or pressure indicator show the correct pressure?

                importantly, extinguishers that are labeled for Class A fires only  cannot be used on electrical or
                grease fires. However, it is safe to use an extinguisher labeled for Class  B and C fires on a Class A
                fire. While Class K fires are technically a subset of Class B fires, other contents  in Class B
                extinguishers can make

                Class K fires

                worse, so it’s best to get a separate extinguisher for cooking fires.
