            INTEGRATED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE
        </h1>

        <p>
            IDSR
            – Is a
            strategy for a multi-disease surveillance of selected priority diseases or conditions which links the
            community, health facility, district and national levels allowing the rational use of resources for disease
            control and prevention.

        </p>
        <p>

            Integrated Disease Surveillance


            is a


            comprehensive approach used by public health systems to monitor, detect, and respond to various diseases and
            health events in a coordinated manner.

        </p>
        <p>

            Surveillance


            – Is the


            ongoing systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health data.


            It includes the timely dissemination and use of information for public health actions.

        </p>
        <p>

            Surveillance is also used for planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practices at  any
            level

        </p>
        <p>

            Disease surveillance


            refers to monitoring of diseases and factors affecting their  distribution/trends in order that action may
            be taken of the health system.

        </p>
        <p>

            Disease Outbreak


            :


            A sudden increase in the number of cases of a particular disease in a defined geographic area and time
            period that is greater than what is normally expected.

        </p>
        <p>

            Communicable Diseases


            :


            Also known as infectious diseases, these are illnesses caused by microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses,
            fungi, or parasites that can be transmitted from one person to another, directly or indirectly.

        </p>
        <p>

            Case Definition


            :


            A set of standardized criteria that define what constitutes a confirmed case of a particular disease. It
            helps health workers accurately identify and classify cases during disease surveillance.

        </p>
        <p>

            Priority Diseases


            :


            Diseases that are given special attention due to their significant impact on public health and the potential
            for rapid spread and serious consequences. Priority diseases vary by region and context.

        </p>
        <p>

            Supervision, Monitoring, and Evaluation


            :


            These are components of disease surveillance that involve overseeing and assessing the implementation of
            surveillance systems, tracking data quality and completeness, and evaluating the effectiveness of response
            strategies.

        </p>
        <p>

            IDRS


            works in collaboration with bodies under


            Center for Disease Control


            (


            CDC)


            in order to achieve the goal of disease surveillance and response.

        </p>
        <p>

            The outstanding bodies are:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Division of emergency infectious and surveillance services (DEISS)


                . It provides expertise to design, develop, implement, monitor and evaluate strategies for IDSR. They
                organize tools for the program like laboratory equipment.

            </li>
            <li>

                Division of epidemiology and surveillance capacity building:


                provides experts for strengthening target countries by giving information on disease outbreaks.

            </li>
            <li>

                Global Immunization Division (GID)


                that provides experts in surveillance for vaccines for preventable disease and integrated data
                management for an expanded program for immunization related surveillance, routine immunization.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            In 1996, there was a big problem with a disease called Ebola. Because of that, Uganda decided to join the
            IDSR program. They made a CDC to look out for disease outbreaks. Other African countries, like Ethiopia,
            Ghana, and Burkina Faso, also use IDSR to handle outbreaks.

            Basic Ingredient for IDSR


        </h4>
        <p>

            The IDSR also identified basic ingredients for it to achieve the goals as follows: To make IDSR work well,
            we need a few important things:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Clear case definition and reporting mechanism.

            </li>
            <li>

                Efficient communication systems.

            </li>
            <li>

                Basic but sound epidemiological framework.

            </li>
            <li>

                Good laboratory report.

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

                Nurses/Midwives attached to health centres to document the surveillance reports.

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>


            Core functions of IDSR


        </h4>
        <p>

            Step 1 –


            Identify and record cases, conditions and events


            : Use of standard case definitions for  health service delivery points (human, animal and environment),
            simplified case definitions for  community level, to identify priority diseases, conditions, and alerts that
            can signal emerging  public health

        </p>
        <p>

            Step 2 –


            Report suspected cases or conditions or events to the next level for action:


            If this is  an epidemic prone disease or a potential Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
            (PHEIC), or a disease targeted for elimination or eradication, report immediately to the next level

        </p>
        <p>

            Step 3 –


            Analyze (person, place and time) data and interpret findings


            : Surveillance data should  be compiled, analyzed for trends, compared with data from previous periods and
            interpreted for  public health actions at all levels

        </p>
        <p>

            Step 4 –


            Investigate and confirm suspected cases, outbreaks or events


            : Take action to ensure  that the cases, outbreaks or events are investigated and confirmed by laboratory

        </p>
        <p>

            Step 5 –


            Prepare


            : ensure the availability of public health emergency preparedness and  response plans, as well as a
            mechanism for coordination of response measures.


            Take steps in  advance of occurrence of outbreaks or public health events, to prepare teams that may
            respond  quickly and set aside essential supplies and equipment which will be available for immediate 
            action

        </p>
        <p>

            Step 6 –


            Respond


            : On confirmation of the outbreak, coordinate and mobilize resources (human,  financial etc.) to implement
            the appropriate public health response

        </p>
        <p>

            Step 7 –


            Risk communication


            :


            Risk communication is the real-time exchange of information,  advice and opinions between experts, community
            leaders, or officials and the people who are at risk. It encourages communicating with all levels and across
            sectors including communities that  provide data, report outbreaks, cases and events

        </p>
        <p>

            Step 8 –


            Monitor, evaluate, supervise and provide feedback to improve the surveillance  system


            : Assess the effectiveness of the surveillance and response systems, in terms of timeliness,  quality of
            information, preparedness, and overall performance. Provide feedback to reinforce  health workers’ efforts
            to participate in the surveillance system. Take action to correct problems  and make improvements

            Detecting and Planning for Disease Outbreak


        </h4>
        <p>
            From the previous section where we introduced Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR), you
            learned that the main group responsible for controlling diseases is the people who work in the Center for
            Disease Control (CDC), which is usually located in a hospital setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also learned about the important members of the team needed to make the work effective, including
            midwives like yourself who are stationed at the outskirts of the district. With the help of clear case
            definitions, you can accurately detect diseases and provide detailed reports to the CDC.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the earlier part of our community health discussions, you learned how to carry out
            to identify health issues within the community and
            diseases. You also understood that in order to reach a diagnosis for a community health problem, you have to
            perform surveillance. This involves screening through laboratory tests and actively searching for cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, when you’re dealing with infectious diseases, you will follow similar guidelines. You’ll select
            and conduct surveillance activities to gather information, analyze it, interpret the findings, and create a
            report for the CDC to take action.
        </p>
        <p>
            To carry out these activities effectively, you need to organize your

            <em>
                <strong>
                    team
                </strong>
            </em>

            , which will consist of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    District Health Officer:
                </strong>
                This is an important leader who oversees health activities in the district.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Community Health Workers:
                </strong>
                These are the frontline workers who engage directly with the community and gather information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Laboratory Technician:
                </strong>
                This person handles lab tests and analysis, which is crucial for confirming diseases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Subordinate Nurses:
                </strong>
                You’ll work with at least one nurse who assists you in carrying out various tasks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Together, this team will collaborate and follow the outlined guidelines until the final step of report
            writing. This coordinated effort ensures timely and accurate response to disease outbreaks and contributes
            to safeguarding public health.
        </p>
        <h4>


            Approaches to public health surveillance


        </h4>
        <p>

            A. Passive surveillance


            : a system by which a health institution receives routine reports  submitted from health facilities and the
            community. This is the most common, and it includes  the surveillance of diseases and other public health
            events through the Health Management  Information System (HMIS)

        </p>
        <p>

            B. Active surveillance


            : It involves actively looking for the cases in the community or health facilities through;

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Records review by health workers at health facility level

            </li>
            <li>

                Screening for specific health conditions e.g., at points of entry, health  facilities etc.

            </li>
            <li>

                Regular communication and keeping in touch with key reporting sources.  This may take various forms such
                as telephone calls to health care workers  at a facility or laboratory or physically moving to the site.

            </li>
            <li>

                Finding additional cases and contacts during outbreaks.

            </li>
            <li>

                Finding diseases targeted for elimination and eradication e.g., Polio (through  Acute Flaccid Paralysis
                (AFP) surveillance), Guinea Worm etc.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            C. Integrated Disease Surveillance


            : This approach aims at collecting health data for multiple  diseases using standardized tools, and supports
            Early Warning Alert and Response (EWAR)  systems. To ensure robust early warning and prompt response, the
            IDSR data collection and analysis system relies on two main channels of information or signal generation,
            namely:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Indicator Based Surveillance (IBS)

            </li>
            <li>

                Event-Based Surveillance (EBS).

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            Indicator-based surveillance (IBS)

        </p>
        <p>

            Indicator-based surveillance


            is the


            regular, systematic, identification, collection, monitoring,  analysis and interpretation of structured
            data, such as indicators produced by a number of well  identified, mostly health-based formal sources.


            Methods of indicator-based surveillance  include; facility-based surveillance, case-based surveillance,
            sentinel surveillance, syndromic  surveillance, laboratory-based surveillance, disease-specific surveillance
            and community  based surveillance

            <b>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>

            Event- based surveillance (EBS)

        </p>
        <p>

            Event-based surveillance


            is


            rapid capture of information about events that are of potential risk  to public health


            . Information is initially captured as a rumor or signal with the potential of  becoming an alert after
            verification. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such  they all need to be triaged and
            verified before a response is initiated.

            DETECTING AND REPORTING OF PRIORITY DISEASES, CONDITIONS/EVENTS


        </h4>
        <p>

            An essential component of a public health surveillance system is its ability to detect priority  diseases
            which fall within the mandate of public health officials at all levels. Early detection, reporting and
            response of public health events help to reduce the burden of  mortality and morbidity.

        </p>
        <p>

            Detection of suspected cases of outbreak prone diseases always be vigilant in your health facility and
            community for the following;

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Targeted outbreak prone diseases, conditions and events.

            </li>
            <li>

                Conditions that are reported more frequently than expected in the community.

            </li>
            <li>

                Cluster (group) of diseases or sudden deaths following public gatherings.

            </li>
            <li>

                Any unusual events that may cause health risks.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            Health staff (human, animals and environmental) conduct surveillance activities at all levels of  the health
            system (public and private) so that they can detect public health problems of concerns  in their community.

        <ul>
            <li>

                Community Case definition for all priority diseases plays important roles in surveillance by 
                facilitating early detection and action to priority diseases, conditions and events.

            </li>
            <li>

                Community members should be oriented in surveillance so that they actively participate in  detecting,
                reporting, responding to and monitoring health events related to humans or animals in  their catchment
                areas.

            </li>
            <li>

                Encourage vigilance in ensuring that these events are identified and reported on time to facilitate 
                early and quick response.

                High rate of hospital admission for the same disease or symptoms.

            </li>
            <li>

                Community members report unusual events or occurrences at local level such as clusters of deaths or
                unusual disease patterns to the health facility or perhaps school.

            </li>
            <li>

                Health workers who conducted routine record reviews to find cases for a specific disease  observe that
                cases of another priority disease have not been reported e.g. AFP, cholera,  measles.

            </li>
            <li>

                During conducting routine record reviews of lab register and observe recorded continued  cases of
                priority diseases e.g. yellow fever, cholera.

            </li>
            <li>

                Radio/T.V, newspapers or social media report a rumor of rare or unexplained events in  the area with
                potential exposure for humans.

            A STANDARD CASE DEFINITION


        </h3>
        <p>

            Case definition


            is an


            agreed-upon set of criteria used to decide if a person has a particular suspected  disease or condition


            . The definition specifies clinical criteria, laboratory diagnosis and  specifications on time, place and
            person.

        </p>
        <p>

            A


            case definition


            of a disease is a


            standardized set of criteria that outlines the specific characteristics and symptoms that an individual must
            meet in order to be classified as having that particular disease


        </p>
        <p>

            It serves as a clear guideline for healthcare professionals and public health authorities to accurately
            identify and classify cases of the disease.

        </p>
        <p>

            In simpler terms, a


            case definition is like a checklist that helps healthcare workers determine whether a person’s symptoms and
            characteristics match those of a specific disease


            . If they meet the criteria in the checklist, they can be considered a “case” of that disease. This is
            important for accurate disease tracking, monitoring, and response.

                To help decide if a person has a presumed disease or condition or event, or to exclude  other potential

            Three-tiered classification system is normally used – Suspect, Probable, Confirmed:

        </p>
        <p>

            A Suspected case


            : indicative clinical picture i.e., patient will have fewer or atypical clinical  features without being a
            confirmed or a probable case

        </p>
        <p>

            Probable case


            : Clear clinical picture (meets the clinical case definition) i.e., patient will have  typical clinical
            features of the illness or linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case but a  laboratory sample cannot be
            taken because the case is lost or dead or a sample has been taken but  not available for laboratory testing
            or was not viable for sufficient laboratory testing

        </p>
        <p>

            Confirmed case


            : A suspected or confirmed case verified by laboratory analysis.

            As a quick reminder,


            priority diseases


            are


            communicable diseases


            caused by


            biological agents


            or


            their


            products


        </p>
        <p>

            They spread from one person to another and are called priority diseases because of their serious impact on
            humans. Many of these diseases can lead to disasters, increase illness and death, and even cause economic
            problems for a country.

        </p>

                Poliomyelitis


                :


                Recent research shows an increasing trend in this disease, which causes muscle weakness or paralysis,
                often in the legs.

            </li>
            <li>

            The Different Levels Where Surveillance Activities Are Performed


        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Community


                : Represented by basic community-level services such as VHTs, village leaders (religious, political,
                traditional), school teachers, extension workers, veterinarians, chemical and drug sellers, and
                traditional healers.

            </li>
            <li>

                Health facility:


                For surveillance purposes, all institutions (public and private health services providers) with
                outpatient and/or in-patient facilities are defined as a “health facility.”

            </li>
            <li>

                Health Sub-district (HSD)


                : The HSD is the basic level for delivery of the Uganda National Minimum Health Care Package. It is
                mandated with planning, organization, budgeting, supervision, and management of health services at this
                and lower-level health centres. It carries an oversight function of health care services within the HSD
                with a referral facility at the level of a general hospital or HC IV. For surveillance purposes, the HSD
                receives and reviews reports from lower-level health facilities in its catchment area and submits
                aggregated reports to the district.

            </li>
            <li>

                District


                : The District Health Services have the responsibility of planning and directing implementation,
                supervision, and monitoring of integrated service delivery in the context of the One Health approach.

            </li>
            <li>

                Regional Level:


                It consists of regional referral hospitals (RRH), which provide referral services, support supervision,
                and response to public health threats to the districts within their respective regions.

            </li>
            <li>

                National level


                : The national health system consists of the Ministry of Health and other national-level institutions,
                including national referral hospitals, national reference laboratories, and national medical stores. It
                is where policies, guidelines, and standard operating procedures are developed and resources allocated.
                In relation to surveillance, this level reports on priority diseases and uses the IHR decision
                instrument.

            Why is it important to involve a nurse in IDSR programs?

        </p>
        <p>

            Answer


            : Nurses are vital in IDSR programs as they assume significant roles in healthcare delivery. Their
            involvement is crucial due to their extensive patient interactions and responsibilities in various
            healthcare settings. Nurses often serve as the frontline healthcare providers, offering care, education, and
            support to patients. Their presence in IDSR ensures early detection, prompt response, and effective
            management of disease outbreaks, leading to improved community health outcomes.
