            References refers to a list of all intext cited works.

        </blockquote>
        <p>

            The researcher is supposed to develop a reference list at the end of your proposal. This list enables the
            reader or user  of this proposal to conveniently retrieve each of the sources of information that the
            researcher reviewed.

        </p>
        <p>

            Whenever you use someone else’s words or ideas in your research paper, you must indicate that this
            information is borrowed by quoting the source of information in the paper itself (


            in text referencing


            ), and at the end of the paper (


            reference list


            ). This applies to written sources you have used such as books, articles web pages, e.t.c

        </p>
        <p>

            Reference is used to tell the reader where ideas from other sources have been used in the research paper.

        </p>
        <p>

            Referencing is a crucial part of successful academic writing, avoiding plagiarism and maintaining academic
            integrity in your assignments and research.

        </p>
        <h4>


            Purpose/Importance of Referencing: WHY DO WE REFERENCE?


        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Giving Credit to Others


                : Referencing is a way of acknowledging and giving credit to the original authors or creators of ideas,
                theories, and works that you incorporate into your own writing.

                Example

                :


                If you use a quote from a book in your research, proper referencing indicates who wrote that quote
                originally.

            </li>
            <li>

                Enhancing Credibility and Authority:


                By citing reputable sources, referencing lends credibility and authority to your arguments. It shows
                that your ideas are supported by established knowledge and research. Referencing gives your argument
                evidence, credibility and authority.

                Example

                :


                Referring to well-known studies or academic papers in your field strengthens the reliability of your
                statements.

            </li>
            <li>

                Providing a Trail to the Original Source:


                References act as signposts, guiding readers to the original works. This allows interested readers to
                move deeper into the topic by exploring the sources you used.

                Example

                :


                A reader who gets interested in your work can trace it back to the specific research study through your
                references.

            </li>
            <li>

                Avoiding Plagiarism


                : Failure to acknowledge the work of others may lead to plagiarism. Proper referencing is essential to
                avoid unintentional or intentional plagiarism, demonstrating academic integrity.

                Example

                :


                Copying and pasting a paragraph from a source without proper citation is considered plagiarism.

            </li>
            <li>

                Distinguishing Your Ideas


                :


                Referencing allows you to differentiate your original thoughts from those borrowed from external
                sources. It is a way of distinguishing your ideas from those of other sources.

            </li>
            <li>

                Facilitating Fact-Checking:


                Proper referencing enables others to fact-check your work. Interested readers or researchers can verify
                the accuracy of your statements by consulting the original sources.

                Example

                :


                Including page numbers in your citations allows readers to locate specific information in the referenced
                source.

            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>

            A


            referencing style


            is a set of rules on how to acknowledge the thoughts, ideas and works of others in a particular way.

        </p>
        <p>

            In your document, referencing is done at


            two levels


            ; first you need to give a brief  reference in the body of text called “


            in-text citation


            ”, and secondly a detailed  reference is provided at the end of the document in the form of a


            list


        </p>
        <h5>


            Types of referencing styles


        </h5>
        <p>

            The two commonest styles used are;

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                APA (American psychological Association) style.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                    MLA (Modern Language Association) style.

                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            Other styles are;

        <h4>


            APA STYLE OF REFERENCING


        </h4>
        <p>

            APA style uses the author/date method of citation in which the author’s last name and the year of the
            publication are inserted in the actual text of the paper. It is the style recommended by the American
            Psychological Association and used in many of the social sciences

        </p>
        <p>


            It is the
            <b>

                    Author Prominent Style of Referencing
                </i>
            </b>


        </p>
        <h5>


            General Rules for In-text Citation:


        </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>

                In-text citation


                utilizes the


                last name (surname)


                of the


                author


                , followed by a


                comma


                and the


                year


                of publication.


                Example


                :

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            (Ghaznavi, 2003).

        </p>
        <p>

            2. If a


            page number


            follows the publication


            year


            , a


            comma


            is added. Example:

        </p>
        <p>

            (Ghaznavi, 2003, p. 40).

        </p>
        <p>

            3. Alternatively, the


            author’s name


            can be written


            outside


            the bracket. Example:

        </p>
        <p>

            Ghaznavi (2003, p. 40) observes…

        </p>
        <p>

            4. Punctuation marks come after the citation, not before.

        </p>
        <p>

            When you provide an


            in-text citation


            in the body of your writing, any punctuation marks, such as


            commas


            or


            periods


            , should come


            after


            the citation.

        </p>
        <p>

            For example:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Correct


                : “This is an important point (Smith, 2021).”

            </li>
            <li>
                <br />
                <p>

                    Incorrect


                    : “This is an important point, (Smith, 2021).”

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            In the correct example


            , the


            period


            is placed


            after


            the citation within the


            parentheses/brackets


            . This is to ensure that the


            citation


            is clearly associated with the information it is referencing, and punctuation does not interfere with the
            citation’s structure.

            4. Each


            reference


            has a


            hanging indent

                In in-text citation only the last name (surname) of the author is used, author’s name and year of
                publication are not separated by a comma (,). For example:
                <b>
                    (Ghaznavi 2003)
                </b>
            </li>
            <li>
                A comma (,) is put after the publication year if a page number is mentioned after it.
                <b>
                    (Ghaznavi 2003, p 40)
                </b>
            </li>
            <li>
                It is also allowed to write the author’s name out of the bracket. For example:
                <b>
                    Ghaznavi (2003, p 40) observes
                </b>
                ………..
            </li>
            <li>
                Punctuation marks such as comma or full stop are used after the citation and not before them.

                        Purpose:
                    </strong>
                    Both APA and Harvard styles aim to provide clear and consistent guidelines for citing sources in
                    academic writing. They help to ensure that readers can easily identify and locate the sources used
                    in a research paper or other academic work.

                    </strong>
                    Both APA and Harvard styles utilize the author-date system for in-text citations. This means that
                    the author’s last name and the year of publication are included in parentheses within the text to
                    indicate the source of the information.

                    </strong>
                    Both APA and Harvard styles require that the reference list or bibliography be arranged
                    alphabetically by the author’s last name. This makes it easy for readers to find the full
                    bibliographic information for each source.

                        In-text citations:
                    </strong>
                    APA and Harvard styles differ in the specific format for in-text citations. APA uses the author-date
                    system with parentheses around the author’s last name, the year of publication, and the page number
                    (if applicable). Harvard style omits the parentheses and uses a comma after the author’s last name,
                    followed by a period, the year of publication, and a colon before the page number (if applicable).

                        Reference list vs. bibliography:
                    </strong>
                    APA uses a reference list, which includes all sources cited in the paper, whether they are books,
                    articles, websites, or other formats. Harvard uses a bibliography, which includes only sources that
                    are referred to or mentioned in the paper.

                        Formatting:
                    </strong>
                    APA and Harvard styles have different formatting requirements for the reference list or
                    bibliography. APA uses specific indentation rules, double spacing, and a hanging indent for each
                    entry. Harvard uses a consistent indentation for all entries, single spacing, and no hanging indent.
