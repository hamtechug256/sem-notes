            Introduction to research

        </h4>
        <blockquote>
            Research is the systematic collection, analysis

            and interpretation of data to answer a certain


            question or solve a problem

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Research is a term derived from the combination of two words: “
            <b>
                re
            </b>
            ” and “
            <b>
                search
            </b>
            .” “Re” is a prefix meaning “again” or “anew,” and “search” is a verb signifying a close and careful
            examination, testing, probing, or trying. When combined, research becomes a noun describing a meticulous,
            systematic, and persistent study and investigation in a specific field of knowledge, carried out to
            establish facts or principles.

            Research is an investigative process aimed at finding reliable solutions to problems through a systematic

            It encompasses all activities that enable us to discover new knowledge about the world around us. The
            process of research involves defining and redefining problems, formulating theories or suggested solutions,
            collecting, organizing, and evaluating data, making deductions and reaching conclusions, and rigorously
            testing those conclusions against the formulated hypothesis or theory.

            <strong>
                APPLIED RESEARCH:
            </strong>

            Refers to the scientific study that solves practical problems. Applied research is used to find solutions to
            every day problems, cure illness and develop innovative technologies, rather than to acquire knowledge for
            the knowledge’s sake. E.g. improve agricultural crop production, Treat or cure specific diseases
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                BASIC REASEARCH:
            </strong>

            It is driven by a scientist’s curiosity or interest in a scientific question. The main motivation is to
            expand man’s knowledge, not to create or invent something.
            <br />
            There is no obvious commercial value to the discoveries from results from basic research E.g. How did the
            universe begin ?, What is the specific genetic code of a fruit fly ?
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                CORRELATIONAL RESEARCH:
            </strong>

            Refers to the systematic investigation or statistical study of relationships among two or more variables
            without necessarily determining the cause and effect. It seeks to establish a
            relation/association/correlation between two or more variables. E.g. testing whether listening to music
            lowers blood pressure levels i.e. assign the groups to experimental and control
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH:
            </strong>

            Refers to research that provides an accurate portrayal of characteristics of a particular individual,
            situation, or group. It is also known as
            <em>
                statistical research
            </em>
            , these studies are a means of discovering new meaning, describing what exists, determining the
            <br />
            the frequency with which something occurs, and categorizing information. E.g Finding the most frequent
            disease that affects
            <br />
            children of a given town.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH:
            </strong>

            Refers to an investigation of culture through an in-depth study of the members of the culture; It involves
            systematic collection, description, and analysis of data for development of theories of cultural behavior
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH:
            </strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            Refers to an objective, systematic, controlled investigation for the purpose of predicting and controlling
            phenomena and examining probability and causality among selected variables. E.g determining the efficacy of
            a particular drug in population
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                EXPLORATORY RESEARCH:
            </strong>

            Is the type of research conducted for a problem that has not been clearly defined. Exploratory
            <br />
            research helps to determine the best research design, data collection method, and selection of subjects. The
            results of exploratory research are not usually useful for decision making by themselves, but they can
            provide significant insight into a given situation. It is not typically generalizable to the population
            <br />
            at large.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                GROUNDED THEORY RESEARCH:
            </strong>

            Is a research approach designed to discover what problems exist in a given social environment and
            <br />
            how persons involved handle them; It involves formulation, testing and reformulation of propositions until a
            theory is developed. Grounded theory is the research method operates almost in reverse fashion from
            <br />
            traditional research at first may appear to be in contradiction with to the scientific method.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                HISTORICAL RESEARCH:
            </strong>

            This is research involving analysis of events that occurred in remote or recent past. Historical research
            can show patterns that occurred in the past and over time which can help us to see where we came from and
            what kind of solutions we used in the past.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                PHENOMENALOGICAL RESEARCH:
            </strong>

            It is an inductive, descriptive research
            <br />
            approach developed from phenomenological philosophy; its aim is to describe an experience as it actually
            lived by the person. Phenomenology is concerned with the study of experience from the perspectives of the
            individuals.

                These studies are a means of discovering new meaning, describing what exists, determining the frequency

                impact on the lives of the people it deals with. For example, finding the most frequent disease that
                affects the children of a town. The reader of the research will know what to do to prevent that disease
                thus, more people will live a healthy life.

            example, although you certainly can conduct a survey on job satisfaction and afterwards say that the percent
            of your respondents were very satisfied with their jobs, it is not possible to come up with an accurate,
            standard numerical scale to measure the level of job satisfaction precisely.
