            Pain assessment

        <p>
            We cannot assess pain without understanding what pain is, right? Let us first explore pain!

            Pain



        </h5>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Pain is an unpleasant experience that involves both physical sensations and emotions, often connected to
                actual or possible harm to body tissues.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Pain is defined by the person experiencing it and exists as they perceive it. “Pain is what the patient says
            hurts.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Pain is subjective, as individuals shape their own understanding of pain based on their personal
            experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pain is the most common and feared symptom among those nearing the end of life. It affects around 98% of
            cancer
            and
            patients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cancer pain is typically constant and worsens as the disease progresses.
        </p>
        <p>
            In developing countries where less than 5% of cancer patients have access to chemotherapy or radiotherapy,
            pain
            tends to worsen gradually until death.

                Lower limb pain (66%) caused by peripheral neuropathy

            </i>
            : Acute pain serves as a useful mechanism that alerts organisms to the presence of harmful or potentially
            harmful stimuli in their environment, such as extreme heat or cold.

                Acute Pain in Cancer:

            Cancer patients may experience pain due to different factors, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Direct effects of the disease, such as tumors infiltrating sensitive structures that cause pain
            </li>
            <li>
                Treatment-related effects, like radiotherapy that can harm visceral, musculoskeletal, and nervous
                tissues.
            </li>
            <li>
                Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are all associated with potential side effects that may cause
                pain.

            Classification of Pain



        </h3>
        <p>
            Pain comes in various forms and can be categorized based on its duration (acute or chronic) and its
            underlying
            physiological mechanism (nociceptive or neuropathic).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is common for multiple types of pain to coexist. To effectively assess and treat pain, it is important to
            identify the specific type(s) of pain being experienced

            Principles for Assessing and Managing Pain

            <li>
                <p>
                    Comprehensive Approach: All aspects of total pain, including psychological, spiritual, social,
                    cultural,
                    and physical dimensions, should be addressed during pain assessment and management.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Multiple Causes of Pain: Pain can stem from various sources such as diseases (e.g., HIV), their
                    consequences (e.g., opportunistic infections), treatments (e.g., chemotherapy), or concurrent
                    disorders
                    (e.g., arthritis).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Goal of Palliative Care: The aim of palliative care is to alleviate pain effectively, ensuring it
                    does
                    not significantly impact the patient’s quality of life.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Subjectivity of Pain: Pain is a subjective experience, relying on what the patient communicates and
                    describes.

                    children
                    and should be addressed appropriately.

            Clinical Presentation of Pain



        </h4>
        <p>
            Different types and causes of pain manifest with distinct clinical presentations:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Visceral Pain: This type of pain is not well localized and presents as a constant, aching sensation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bone Pain: Bone pain is well localized with local tenderness. It resembles a nagging toothache,
                    worsens
                    with movement and weight bearing, and is often caused by the release of prostaglandins.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Colic: Colic refers to gripping pain associated with spasms, typically occurring in the middle or
                    upper
                    abdomen (bowel) or related to micturition (bladder).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Raised Intracranial Pressure: Increased pressure within the skull results in a generalized headache
                    that
                    worsens in the mornings, when lying down, and during coughing. This type of pain may be accompanied
                    by
                    symptoms like nausea, projectile vomiting, and blurred vision.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Neuropathic Pain: Neuropathic pain is constant or aggravated by movement. It is described as
                    burning,
                    sharp, stabbing, shooting, or a nagging ache. It may be associated with altered sensation and can
                    follow
                    a dermatomal distribution.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Spiritual Pain: Spiritual pain is an emotional form of suffering, often expressed through dreams or
                    nightmares.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Other Forms of Pain: Patients may exhibit refusal to take medication or engage in self-harming
                    behaviors
                    as active manifestations of pain.
