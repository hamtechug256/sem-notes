                Health:
            </strong>
            Health refers to a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of
            disease or infirmity.

        <p>
            <strong>
                Disease:
            </strong>
            A disease is a specific abnormal condition that affects the body or mind and impairs normal functioning. It
            is often characterized by specific symptoms and signs.

            Introduction


        </h4>
        <p>
            There are three elements that determine the etiology of health problems in a population:
            <em>
                Agent, Host, and Environment
            </em>
            . These are referred to as the epidemiological triad.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Epidemiology
            </em>
            is the study of the distribution and determinants of diseases and health-related events in human
            populations.
        </p>
        <p>
            A disease occurs when the agent is more powerful than the host, causing the host to weaken and the
            environment to become favorable for the growth, multiplication, and survival of the agent.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is possible when the host becomes stronger, the agent is removed, and the environment becomes
            unfavorable to the agent.
        </p>
        <h4>


            Agent


        </h4>
        <p>
            It is a factor whose presence or absence causes a disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a specific factor without which a disease cannot occur.

            is defined as a substance, living or non-living, or a force, tangible or non-tangible, the excessive
            presence or relative lack of which is the immediate cause of a particular disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            The disease agent is classified as follows:
        </p>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Physical Agents:
            </strong>
            Various mechanical forces or frictions that may produce injury, as well as atmospheric abnormalities such as
            extremes of heat, cold, humidity, pressure, radiation, electricity, sound, etc.

                    </strong>
                    Some chemicals may be produced in the body as a result of decayed function, e.g., urea (uraemia),
                    ketones, ketosis, sodium, bilirubin (jaundice), uric acid (gout), CaCO3 (kidney stones), among

                        Exogenous Agents:
                    </strong>
                    These arise from outside the human host, such as allergens, metals, fumes, insecticides, etc. They
                    may be acquired by inhalation, ingestion, or inoculation.

            Transmitted from parent to child through genes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Mechanical Agents:
            </strong>
            Chronic friction and other mechanical forces resulting in injuries, trauma, fractures, sprains,
            dislocations, and even death.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Nutrient Agents:
            </strong>
            Dietary components needed for survival, e.g., proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and water.
            The excessive or deficient intake of nutrients can lead to malnutrition, which in turn leads to
            susceptibility to disease.

        <p>
            <strong>
                Definition:
            </strong>
            Communicable disease is an illness due to specific infectious agents and their toxic products, which, under
            certain conditions, tend to spread among individuals in a community.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Period of Communicability:
            </strong>
            This refers to the time during which an infectious agent may be transferred directly or indirectly from an
            infected person to a susceptible person. This period is usually equal to the maximum known incubation period
            for that disease.

            Modes of Transmission of Communicable Diseases


        </h4>
        <p>
            The modes of transmission may be classified into two broad categories: direct and indirect.
        </p>
        <h4>


            Direct Transmission


        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Direct Contact:
                </strong>
                e.g., sexual contact, kissing, and continued close contact. Diseases transmitted here include STIs/HIV,
                Leprosy, and Scabies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Droplet Infection:
                </strong>
                Through coughs, sneezing; diseases like common cold, TB, measles, whooping cough, meningitis, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Contact with Infected Soil:
                </strong>
                e.g., Tetanus infective hookworm larvae.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Inoculation into Skin or Mucosa:
                </strong>
                e.g., animal bites (dog bites -rabies and HIV or Hepatitis B virus from contaminated needle pricks).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Transplacental or Vertical Transmission:
                </strong>
                e.g., toxoplasmosis, HIV, rubella virus, syphilis.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>


            Indirect Transmission


        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Vehicle-Borne Transmission:
                </strong>
                The common vehicle of transmission is water, milk, or food; other vehicles may be blood, serum, plasma,
                and other biological products. This group includes waterborne, milk-borne, food-borne, and bloodborne
                infections, e.g., enteric fever, cholera, dysentery, diarrhea, hepatitis A, B, E, food poisoning.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Vector-Borne Transmission:
                </strong>
                e.g., malaria, filarial, kala-azar, and plague are transmitted by insects. The mode of transmission is
                vector transmission.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Airborne Transmission:
                </strong>
                e.g., Droplet nuclei (very small infective particles that float in the air, e.g., TB, infected dust; due
                to sweeping or dusty infected settled droplets on the ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Fomite-Borne Transmission:
                </strong>
                Fomites are articles that convey infection to others because they have been contaminated, e.g.,
                handkerchief, drinking glasses, doorknobs, clothing, etc. Highly infectious diseases, e.g., Ebola, can
                be easily transmitted by fomites.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Disease Transmission Cycle (The Chain of Infection)


        </h3>
        <p>
            For a communicable disease to spread, a series of linked events must occur. This is known as the
            <strong>
                Chain of Infection
            </strong>
            . Breaking any link in this chain can stop the spread of disease. As a nurse, understanding this cycle is
            fundamental to infection control.

                An infectious disease transmissible under natural conditions from vertebrate animals to humans is called
                a zoonosis. There are over 150 diseases common to both humans and animals. Examples include anthrax,
                liver fluke, bovine TB, salmonellosis, brucellosis, rabies, plague, typhus, and yellow fever.

                An infection occurring in a patient in a hospital or other healthcare facility and in whom it was not
                present or incubating at the time of admission or arrival at a healthcare facility is called a
                nosocomial infection. It refers to diseases transmitted from a hospital. Usually, such infections are
                more difficult to manage as they are generally resistant to most common antibiotics. Nosocomial
                infections also include those infections contracted in the hospital but manifested after discharge and
                infections suffered by staff members if they were exposed to the infection from hospitalized patients.

                    Herd Immunity:
                </strong>
                The immune status of a group of people/community is called herd immunity as it represents the immune
                status of the population. For many communicable diseases, an outbreak of the disease is only possible if
                the level of immunity is sufficiently low, and there are a large number of susceptible individuals in
                the population. In diseases like poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles, etc., herd immunity plays an
                important role. However, in diseases like tetanus or rabies, where every individual is at risk unless
                specifically protected, herd immunity plays no role.

            This refers to the reduction of the incidence and prevalence of communicable diseases to a level where they
            cannot be a major public health problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three main methods of controlling communicable diseases:

        <ol>
            <li>
                Eliminating the reservoir (attacking the source)

            Eliminating the Reservoir (Attacking the Source)


        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Detection and Adequate Treatment of Cases:
                </strong>
                This arrests the communicability of the disease, e.g., control of tuberculosis and leprosy and most
                sexually transmitted diseases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Isolation:
                </strong>
                This means that the person with the disease is not allowed to come into close contact with other people
                except those who are providing care, preventing the organism from spreading. It is used to control
                highly infectious diseases such as hemorrhagic viral fevers.

            <li>
                <strong>
                    Quarantine:
                </strong>
                Limitation of the movement of apparently well persons or animals who have been exposed to the infectious
                disease for the duration of the maximum incubation period of the disease.

                <strong>
                    Reservoir Control:

                In diseases that have their main reservoir in animals, mass treatment, chemoprophylaxis, or immunization
                of the animals can be carried out, e.g., in brucellosis. Other methods include separating humans from
                animals or killing the animals and thus destroying the reservoir, e.g., plague, rabies, and hydatid
                disease.
            </li>
            <li>

            Screening of Diseases


        </h3>
        <p>
            Screening denotes the search for unrecognized diseases or defects in apparently healthy persons through the
            application of rapid diagnostic tests, examinations, or procedures. The basic objective of screening is to
            facilitate an early diagnosis so that the prognosis can be improved by remedial action.

                <strong>
                    Mass Screening:
                </strong>
                When all members of a population are screened for disease, it is called mass screening. This is very
                costly, and the yield of cases is usually too small to warrant such a screening procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    High-Risk Screening:
                </strong>
                High risk or selective screening refers to the situation where tests are offered only to those
                individuals who are at high risk of developing a specific disease. This makes the screening process more
                focused and reduces overall costs, as a large number of people with extremely remote chances of
                developing a disease are not screened.

                <strong>
                    Sensitivity:
                </strong>
                This refers to the proportion of truly diseased individuals in the population who have been correctly
                identified as diseased by the screening test. A test with high sensitivity gives only a few false
                negatives.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Specificity:
                </strong>
                This refers to the proportion of normal individuals who are correctly labeled as non-diseased by the
                screening test. A test with high specificity will only give a few false positives. It is desirable that
                a screening test should have high sensitivity and specificity.

            Disease Outbreak

        <h4>


            Introduction


        </h4>
        <p>
            An epidemic is the occurrence of a disease clearly in excess of normal expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of cases that should be diagnosed before declaring an epidemic status depends on the number of
            cases routinely seen in that area. In an area where a disease has not been seen for many years, even the
            occurrence of a single case may be sufficient to call it an epidemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Epidemic diseases need not necessarily be communicable diseases; therefore, WHO also looks at smoking as an
            epidemic. A pandemic is an epidemic that breaks out across many continents, occurring across the world. Some
            pandemic diseases include HIV/AIDS, Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis, and smoking, as they have affected
            millions of people across the world. Plague was also pandemic in historical times.
        </p>
        <h4>


            Endemic diseases:


        </h4>
        <p>
            The constant, continuous, or usual presence of a disease in a defined geographic area or delimited territory
            is called an endemic disease. An endemic disease may become an epidemic if the number of cases usually seen
            suddenly increases in proportion. Malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, filariasis, etc., are examples of endemic
            diseases.
        </p>
        <h4>


            Causes of Epidemics


        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Unplanned and under-planned urbanization.
            </li>
            <li>
                Overcrowding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Poor sanitation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deteriorating public health infrastructure, e.g., blocked sewage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Resistance to antibiotics.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increased exposure of humans to disease vectors and reservoirs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Other important factors responsible for epidemics include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Illiteracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ignorance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Low socioeconomic status.
            </li>
            <li>
                High population growth, etc.

            Individual Cases


        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Managing individual cases demands a proper history and meticulous physical examination to clinically
                rule out all possible causes of fever in that area.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consideration of appropriate laboratory investigation will also assist in narrowing down the list of
                possible differential diagnoses and arriving at the right diagnosis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment should be promptly instituted accordingly (see the satellite
                module for health officers’ algorithm).
            </li>
            <li>
                While managing individual cases, one should make note of their addresses and see if there is any
                clustering of the cases.

            Investigation of an Epidemic

        <p>
            In the investigation of an epidemic, it is wise to follow a systematic approach, although public reaction,
            urgency, and the local situation may make this difficult.
