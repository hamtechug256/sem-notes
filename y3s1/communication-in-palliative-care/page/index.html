            COMMUNICATION IN PALLIATIVE CARE
        </h1>

        <p>

            Communication (as a generic process) is a two-way process between two or more persons in which ideas, 
            feelings and information are shared, with the ultimate aim of reducing uncertainties and clarifying issues.

        </p>
        <p>

            Communication only becomes complete when there is feedback.

        </p>

                    Verbal communication
                </b>

                is the exchange of ideas through spoken expression in words. It is a medium  for communication that can
                entail using the spoken word, such as talking face-to-face, on a telephone,  or through a formal speech;
                similar communication can occur through writing.

                    Non-verbal communication
                </b>

                involves the expression of ideas, thoughts or feelings without the spoken  or written word. This is
                generally expressed in the form of body language that includes gestures and  facial expressions and,
                where appropriate, touches

            : Little communication actually takes place verbally, facial expressions, gestures and posture form most of 
            our communication and are a graphic part of our culture and language. Studies show that during 
            interpersonal communication 7% of the message is verbally communicated, while 93% is non-verbally 
            transmitted.


            Of the 93% non-verbal communication:

            The first and perhaps the most important skill is to be a good listener.


            We have to be able to listen in order to understand the patient and family needs.

            How well do we listen?

        </p>

            Show that you are listening by using the following techniques:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Pay attention to the person you are communicating to.

            </li>
            <li>

                Use body language to show that you are paying attention.

                Encourage the person to talk and show your engagement by nodding or using appropriate facial
                expressions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid behaviors that indicate boredom or impatience, such as yawning, fidgeting, or looking around.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pay attention to the person’s non-verbal cues and reactions to better understand their feelings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use silence constructively and allow the person time to gather their thoughts without rushing them.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a. It is important not to interrupt when the person is speaking. Listen attentively and try to
                understand their verbal message.
            </li>
            <li>
                b. Make an effort to remember accurately what the person has said.

                Gives an opportunity to them to think again about the problem.

                    You have told me that

                It is helpful to use a mixture of open and dosed ended questions. Closed questions help to structure 
                the session and identify facts, and open questions help the patient to express feelings, opinions and 
                experiences.

            </li>

                Ask one question at a time, it is confusing to ask so many questions at a go.

            </li>

                Use key words from the person’s explanation to phrase another question.

            </li>
            <li>

                Be tactful when asking personal or sensitive questions as it can take time to develop trust, and some 
                questions can be asked later once trust has built up.

                Use simple and clear language when asking questions.

            <li>

                Avoid answering “Yes” or ‘No’. It does not help the health professional to effectively understand the
                client’s situation or what the patient and family know about their illness.

            </li>
            <li>

                When answering the clients’ questions or discussing the clients’ concerns, give information rather  than
                advice or false reassurance.

            </li>
            <li>

                Avoid suggesting to the patient and family what to do, but put forward a suggestion for discussion,

            </li>
            <li>

                Always give accurate information. Be honest, it is alright to say. ‘‘I don’t know”.

            </li>
            <li>

                Answer questions using simple and clear language. Complicated medical jargon can confuse the  patient
                and their family.

            </li>
            <li>

                After giving information, check whether the person has understood the information and ask the  person
                what he intends to do about the situation?

            </li>
            <li>

                Remember people ask questions when seeking for help.

            </li>
            <li>

                Sometimes there is no obvious answer’ to give a question, such as ‘Why has God done this to me?”  but
                listening to the patient and helping then, explore the feelings behind this statement can be very 
                helpful to him/her.

                Communication in Children’s Palliative Care
            </u>

        </h3>
        <p>
            In children’s palliative care, communication plays a crucial role as a child’s development and well-being
            are closely tied to the attention and care they receive. Children learn and grow through talking, playing,
            and observing others in their family and social environments. Establishing meaningful relationships with
            adults and peers is vital for their emotional and intellectual development. However, disclosing a diagnosis
            and ensuring adherence to treatment can present unique challenges in pediatric palliative care.
