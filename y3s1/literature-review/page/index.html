            CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW


        </h2>
        <blockquote>

            Literature review refers to the collection of scholarly information about any research problem/topic

        </blockquote>

            <li>

                It is a systematic gathering of information, analysing and reviewing documents from written or done by
                other scholars that have a relation to your problem being investigated

            </li>
            <li>

                It is a requirement for ay researcher to do a preliminary background search of information about a
                problem so that one discovers what has been done and what the gap in the field of study is.

            Purpose of literature review



        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>

                To identify what is already known  in your area of study

            </li>
            <li>

                To justify why you need to study the problem you are interested in since it identifies the gaps.

            </li>
            <li>

                To orient the reader on how the research will be used to make discussion of the findings.

            </li>
            <li>

                To know what has been reported so that you report on what needs to be reported on.

            </li>
            <li>

                    understand the evolution of the topic and its relevance. Literature review helps you understand the
                    story of your research topic. It’s like reading the background of a patient’s medical history before
                    treating them.

                    theories and concepts from previous studies. Imagine you’re learning to give injections. By reading
                    about how experienced nurses do it, you gain insights into different techniques, potential

                    that their study contributes something new to the field. Imagine if nurses gave the wrong dosage of
                    a medicine just because they didn’t know it was dangerous. Reading about such incidents helps you
                    avoid making similar mistakes.

                    important.

                    investigate symptoms to diagnose patients, researchers investigate what’s known to find gaps. This
                    way, you can contribute new information, like a detective solving a medical mystery.

            <strong>
                Citing Within the Text
            </strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            There are two methods for citing within the text:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Parenthetical Citation
                    </strong>
                    : In this method, the author’s last name and the year of publication are placed at the end of a
                    paraphrased statement, both enclosed in parentheses. For instance: The research demonstrated a
                    significant correlation between class performance and absenteeism (Sabiti, 2019).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Narrative Citation
                    </strong>
                    : This method involves placing the author’s name and publication year at the beginning of the
                    sentence. For example: According to Sabiti (2019), there exists a noteworthy correlation between
                    class performance and absenteeism.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            <strong>
                Quotations
            </strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            Quoting directly involves using the exact wording of the author’s statements without alteration. Direct
            quotations are preferred for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ensuring accuracy in conveying the original message.
            </li>
            <li>
                Utilizing exceptionally clear statements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adding emphasis and authority, especially when quoting from a recognized author.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            <strong>
                Footnotes
            </strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            Footnotes are used to display references at the bottom of the page rather than at the end of the main text.

            Its role is to provide additional information to the reader and to indicate the source of the idea.

            They serve two primary purposes:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Providing Additional Information: Footnotes offer supplementary details to enrich the reader’s
                understanding of the content.
            </li>
            <li>
                Source Indication: Footnotes attribute ideas to their sources, ensuring transparency and proper
                citation.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
