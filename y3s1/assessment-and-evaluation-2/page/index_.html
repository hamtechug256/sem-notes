            ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION

            <strong>
                INTRODUCTION
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Education is an activity in which a variety of resources are put, these resources include money, time,
            labor, instructional materials, etc. We need to find out whether we are benefiting from putting all these
            resources into the education of our learners. To do this, we use measurement, assessment, testing, and
            evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Evaluation
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Evaluation is the systematic process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting information that determines
            the effectiveness (value) of an educational program in the light of evidence obtained through research,
            assessment, measurement, testing, experimenting, and consulting. Thus, evaluation can also be defined as the
            process of judging the value or worth of an individual’s achievements. It attempts to provide useful
            feedback information to stakeholders. It facilitates the judgment of what extent the educational objectives
            have been met.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Assessments
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In education, the term assessment means the process of documenting in quantitative terms the knowledge,
            skills, and values attained by the learner. Currently in Ugandan higher institutions, there is continuous
            assessment being emphasized. The results of continuous assessment help teachers keep an accumulative record
            that may be used to assess the overall performance of the learner.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Testing
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a way of discovering by questions or practical activities what someone knows or what someone can do.
            Educationally, we test our learners to find out how much knowledge and skills they possess, and what values
            and attributes they have developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Measurement
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This refers to assigning numbers to a learning program or event in order to describe or represent the amount
            of abilities, characteristics, and potential possessed by a learner. Measurement describes a situation in
            quantitative terms, while evaluation judges its worth or value in qualitative terms, such as good or poor.

                    </strong>
                    It helps us to understand the problem existing within the program; therefore, appropriate action can
                    be taken.

                        Placement and Promotion (Selection):
                    </strong>
                    It helps us correctly find where the individual should belong, i.e., who can be promoted to another
                    class or who goes for which course based on aggregates, e.g., primary leavers are selected according
                    to aggregate got, i.e., whether a student of aggregate 6 can go to Kisubi or whether a student who
                    did MEG can do law.

                    It is the only way one can satisfy the assessment committee to provide evidence about the attainment
                    of a particular skill, e.g., a degree certificate, driving permit, etc.

                    </strong>
                    It helps the teachers to establish a reference point, i.e., the minimum entry point, e.g., At UNMEB
                    exams, a standard is 50% in every paper, which was determined based on how students used to score in
                    the past.

                        Prediction:
                    </strong>
                    The stakeholders are able to determine the future potentials/weaknesses of individuals, e.g., a
                    student who performs well in Physics is likely to be an engineer.

                        Refinement:
                    </strong>
                    The information from the evaluation can help us to improve on the programs by identifying where we
                    are weak. E.g., a teacher looks at the students’ work and sees what topic they have failed, then the
                    teacher tries to simplify his/her teaching.

                        Norms referencing:
                    </strong>
                    It helps us to compare an individual against other individuals or against the system. E.g., a
                    student in the 5th position out of 40 students can be determined by assessments.

                        Remediation:
                    </strong>
                    Results of assessment are a basis for correcting learning responses and clarification of
                    misconceptions. A teacher might decide to organize a remedial class to correct the challenges that
                    students faced during assessments.

                        Motivation:
                    </strong>
                    Feedback from assessment is motivation for future aspiration among learners. For example, a student
                    can be motivated to read harder after good performance in an exam.

                        Purpose of evaluation:
                    </strong>
                    In the evaluation of learners’ progress, one should first identify the learning outcomes to be
                    measured. For example, in nursing education, outcomes could be that learners should possess
                    knowledge in disease management, skills in nursing procedures, and a good attitude in patient care.

                        Availability of assessment tools:
                    </strong>
                    No single evaluation tool is adequate for assessing learners’ progress; make sure you use a variety
                    of techniques to obtain a complete picture of the students’ achievements. Use what is available and
                    can be administered to the learners. For example, a theory exam can evaluate learners’ knowledge,
                    and a practical exam evaluates their skills and attitudes.

                        Validity:
                    </strong>
                    It is a concern about how well the test measures what it is supposed to measure. For example,
                    measuring students’ intelligence using a tape measure around the circumference of the head will not
                    provide accurate measurements of intelligence, so the validity of this tool will be weak.

                    Refers to the action of the assessment method and its relevance to the overall learning goals in the
                    course, addressing whether or not the workload for the instructor is reasonable.

                        In the day-to-day teaching, teachers continuously check on how students are learning. This

            It can involve seeing students’ behavior and listening to oral contributions to evaluate the learners’
            attitude, learning speed, style, intelligence, personal abilities, and progress. This technique can detect
            problems immediately so that corrective measures can be employed, but it’s prone to prejudice and bias from
            the teacher as the observer.

            The teacher asks questions and finally scores the candidate based on the quality of the responses from the
            learner. Examples include interviews, quizzes, panel discussions, case presentations, etc. In nursing,
            traditional oral practical exams were conducted where the teacher would vary questions asked from one
            student to another.

            Teacher-made tests are the most widely used written examination for assessing learning. The construction of
            these tests fundamentally depends on the teacher and can be categorized into two types: Objective and
            Subjective tests.

                Practical examinations are used to evaluate nursing competence in practical skills.  Currently,
                Objective Structured Clinical/Practical Examination (OSCE/OSPE) is the test method used in nursing
                education to assess practical skills.

            <li>
                Examiners use a checklist to evaluate trainees, providing the same problem and tasks to all students
                within the same time frame. The tasks simulate real clinical situations, including history taking,
                physical examinations, simple procedures, interpretation of lab results, patient management problems,
                communication, and attitude, among others. All students are assessed on the same criteria using a
                checklist by the same examiners.
