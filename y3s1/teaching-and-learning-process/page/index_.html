            is a process of acquiring knowledge, skills and attitudes.
            <br />
            After  learning, one’s ability/performance, values and behavior are expected to  change. The learners should
            be helped to undergo or go through the  following mental processes for effective learning:

            Justification/Relevance of Teaching Methodology to a Nurse
        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Qualified nurses, even without tutor training, often serve as the primary teachers for student nurses.
                Therefore, understanding teaching methodology is crucial in the nursing curriculum.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Nurses frequently take on the role of educators, guiding and mentoring student nurses. A solid
                understanding of teaching methodology is essential for effective instruction and shaping the future
                generation of nurses.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>
                Teaching has become an integral part of nurses’ routines, including continuous professional development,
                classroom teaching, and clinical teaching in wards.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Nurses are increasingly involved in educational activities, such as conducting CPD sessions, delivering
                classroom teachings, and providing clinical instruction. Having a sound knowledge of teaching
                methodology allows nurses to deliver effective education in these settings.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                Nurses play a critical role in providing health education.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Nurses are responsible for imparting health-related knowledge to individuals, families, and communities.
                Understanding teaching methodology equips nurses with the necessary skills to effectively communicate
                health information and empower others to make informed decisions about their well-being.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>
                Nurses often engage in media platforms (radio, TV, etc.) to provide educational content.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Nurses are frequently sought after to share their expertise through media engagements. By understanding
                teaching methodology, nurses can effectively communicate complex health topics to a wider audience in a
                clear and accessible manner.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>
                Teaching methodology helps nurses comprehend curriculum planning, design, review, implementation,
                change, and evaluation.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Familiarity with teaching methodology allows nurses to actively participate in the development and
                improvement of nursing curricula. This includes planning effective teaching strategies, implementing
                changes when necessary, and evaluating the outcomes of the curriculum.

                Teaching methodology helps nurses appreciate and utilize advanced educational technology.

        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                As educational technology continues to advance, nurses need to be adept at integrating technology into
                their teaching practices. Teaching methodology provides the foundation for utilizing educational
                technology effectively and enhancing the learning experience.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="7">
            <li>
                Teaching methodology enables nurses to develop a systematic approach to writing schemes of work and
                lesson plans.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Well-structured schemes of work and lesson plans are essential for organized and effective teaching.
                Teaching methodology equips nurses with the skills to plan and deliver educational content in a
                systematic and logical manner.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="8">
            <li>
                Nurses need to learn and apply various teaching methods, utilize teaching aids, and write clear
                objectives.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Different learners respond to different teaching methods, and nurses must be proficient in utilizing
                various techniques to cater to diverse learning styles. Teaching methodology provides the knowledge and
                skills to select appropriate teaching methods, utilize teaching aids effectively, and write clear and
                measurable objectives.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="9">

                Nurses need to learn how to write notes guided by objectives.

        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Documentation is an integral part of nursing practice, and nurses often write notes and reports to
                communicate important information. Understanding teaching methodology assists nurses in writing clear
                and concise notes that align with the objectives of the teaching or training session.

            The proponents  of this theory believe that human beings are born with empty minds  (“tabularasa”).

            Classical conditioning theory suggest  that learners most of the time achieve or succeed after associating
            what  they are learning with a stimulus. Therefore in the environment there must  be something to remind the
            learner his/her role in learning. In his  experiment Pavlov used a bell and food in order to cause salvation
            in a  dog. When food and a bell were paired always the dog salivated. After  several days the bell without
            food could cause salivation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The role of the teacher is to identify a certain stimulus which can stimulate a  learner to learn but this
            must be done frequently to keep the learner alert.  The bell is what the teacher does, the food is the
            knowledge and salivation  is learning by students. (Bell + food) = SALIVATION.
        </p>
        <p>
            In his experiment when he did not pair the bell with the food several times,  the dog stopped salivation.
            When he paired the bell and the food again for
            several days, the dog salivated. Salivating again is called
            <i>
                spontaneous  recovery
            </i>
            . Therefore the teachers should be creative and teach while  demonstrating some practices which can induce
            learning. However, it is  more effective to introduce and withdraw them.

            the theory of operant  conditioning suggests that reinforcement (rewarding, withdrawing reward,  punishment
            and withdrawing punishment) influences learning or change  of behavior. Therefore learning or change of
            behavior is more successful  if the teacher reinforces the learner either during the teaching or after the 
            learner has achieved learning/ good performance/good behavior. This  means that when the learner learns the
            desired or expresses desirable  behavior, rewarding or withdrawing punishment helps to improve, sustain  or
            maintain the good performance. However, with negative performance,  punishment and withdrawing reward can
            cause or revive good  performance.

            this theory suggests that  individuals most of the time learn or change behavior after observing or 
            imitating others. Therefore learning takes place from what others in the  environment do. A teacher and
            other stakeholders in teaching should  provide good examples because they are models to the learners. 
            Learners learn fast and effectively what they have admired from others.
