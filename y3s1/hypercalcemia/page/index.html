        <p>
            Hypercalcemia is a threatening metabolic disorder associated with cancer. It commonly occurs in patients
            with breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and head, neck, and renal tumors.

            HCM most often results from bone metastasis. There is a release of calcium from the bones, which causes
            hypercalcemia. Additionally, cancer treatment modalities such as estrogen and anti-estrogen agents are
            associated with the development of HCM.

                    Specific cancers:

                    Certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, multiple
                    myeloma, and melanomas, are commonly associated with hypercalcemia. The presence of these cancers
                    can lead to the release of calcium from the bones, contributing to elevated calcium levels in the
                    bloodstream.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                    Treatment modalities:

                    Cancer treatment methods, including the use of estrogen and anti-estrogen agents, can be associated
                    with the development of hypercalcemia. These treatment modalities may impact calcium regulation in
                    the body and contribute to increased levels of calcium in the blood.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                    Non-malignant causes:

                    Hypercalcemia can also occur due to non-cancer-related factors. These may include immobility,
                    dehydration, excessive intake of calcium and Vitamin D, decreased levels of parathyroid hormone, and
                    vitamin A intoxication. These factors can disrupt the normal balance of calcium in the body and lead
                    to elevated levels.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                    Lytic bone lesions:

                    In some cases, hypercalcemia can be caused by lytic bone lesions. These are bone abnormalities
                    characterized by the destruction of bone tissue. When bone lesions are present, calcium is released
                    from the bones into the bloodstream, contributing to hypercalcemia. Additionally, there may be a
                    decrease in the excretion of urinary calcium, further elevating calcium levels.

                The management of Hypercalcemia of Malignancy (HCM) may involve treating the underlying malignancy. This
                could include
                , radiation therapy, and/or surgery, depending on the specific cancer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hydration: Patients should aim to consume 1 to 2 liters of fluids per day, if they can tolerate oral
                fluids.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fluid Replacement: For patients with moderate to severe HCM (calcium levels above 13 mg/dL), fluid
                replacement may be necessary to restore extracellular fluid balance. This typically involves
                administering 5 to 10 liters of fluid.
            </li>
            <li>
                Saline Administration: In cases of dehydration or severe hypercalcemia, the administration of saline may
                be required to restore volume and correct electrolyte imbalances.
            </li>
            <li>
                Corticosteroid Therapy: Patients with HCM caused by steroid-responsive tumors may benefit from
                corticosteroid treatment. Corticosteroids can help lower calcium levels in these cases.
            </li>
            <li>
                Symptom Management and Mobility: Management of HCM also involves addressing symptoms associated with
                hypercalcemia and promoting mobility. This may include medications to alleviate bone pain, such as
                nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (
                ), and implementing strategies to improve patient comfort and mobility.
            </li>
            <li>
                Constipation Assessment and Treatment: Patients should be assessed for constipation, as it can be a
                common symptom of hypercalcemia. If constipation is present, appropriate measures should be taken to
                alleviate it.
