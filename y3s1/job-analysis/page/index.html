            The Process of Job Analysis


        </h4>
        <p>

            Step 1:


            Data Collection

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Identify the sources from which you will collect data for job analysis. These sources can include job
                incumbents, supervisors, subject matter experts, and relevant documents.

            </li>
            <li>

                Determine the methods you will use to collect data. Common methods include interviews, questionnaires,
                observations, and reviewing existing documentation.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            Step 2:


            Job Data

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Collect and compile the data obtained from the various sources and methods.

            </li>
            <li>

                Analyze the job data to identify key information about the job, such as tasks, responsibilities,
                knowledge, skills, and abilities required.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            Step 3:


            Job Description

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Create a job description based on the job data. The job description should provide a detailed summary of
                the job’s purpose, essential functions, responsibilities, and reporting relationships.

            </li>
            <li>

                The arrows from the job data should point towards the job description, indicating that the job data is
                used to inform the creation of the job description.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            Step 4:


            Job Specifications

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Develop job specifications based on the job data. Job specifications outline the qualifications,
                experience, and other attributes required for successful performance in the job.

            </li>
            <li>

                The arrows from the job data should also point towards the job specifications, indicating that the job
                data is used to inform the creation of the job specifications.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            Step 5:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Use the job description and job specifications to inform various human resource functions.

            </li>
            <li>

                The arrows from the job description and job specifications should point towards the human resource
                functions, indicating that these documents are used to guide activities such as recruitment, selection,
                training, performance management, and compensation.
