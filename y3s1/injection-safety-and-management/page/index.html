                INJECTION SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT INTRODUCTION
            </em>

        </p>
        <p>
            Injection, or Getting an injection is a very common medical procedure. Most injections, about 95%, are given
            to treat illnesses. Immunizations make up about 3% of all injections, and the rest are used for different
            reasons, like giving blood or contraceptives.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                A Problem to Solve
            </strong>

            : In many countries that are still developing or going through changes, a lot of injections are given when
            they’re not really needed. Sometimes, as many as 9 out of 10 people who go to see a primary health care
            provider get an injection. But more than 70% of these injections aren’t necessary. They could be given as
            medicine you swallow instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                What’s Important:
            </strong>
            After an injection, it’s really important to safely collect and get rid of the used needles and syringes.
            This is a big part of how injections are taken care of from start to finish.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                Three Big Concerns:
            </strong>

            When we think about whether injections are safe, there are three important things to consider:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The person getting the injection should be safe.
            </li>
            <li>
                The health worker giving the injection should be safe.
            </li>
            <li>
                The community where the injections are happening should be safe.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So, making sure injections are done safely is really important for everyone’s well-being.

                Injection Safety Guidelines
            </u>

        </h4>
        <p>
            According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2005),
            <u>
                <i>
                    a safe injection
                </i>
            </u>
            is one that doesn’t harm the person receiving it, doesn’t put the person giving the injection at unnecessary
            risk, and doesn’t create dangerous waste for the community.
        </p>

                Principles to Follow for Safe Injections:
            </u>

        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Always use a new syringe and needle for each vaccine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep injection equipment and vaccine clean to avoid contamination.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare injections in a clean area where there’s little chance of contamination from blood or body
                fluids.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a clean, sterile needle to puncture the top of multi-dose vials.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t leave the needle in the stopper of the vial.
            </li>
            <li>
                Protect your fingers with a small gauze pad when opening ampoules.
            </li>
            <li>
                Throw away a needle that touches anything not sterile, like your hands or surfaces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be ready for any sudden movements from the patient during and after the injection.
            </li>
            <li>
                To avoid getting hurt, don’t put the cap back on a used needle; put it straight into a safety box.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put used syringes and needles into a safety box right where you used them, and seal the box when it’s
                full. Don’t move the contents or overfill the boxes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Close and seal the safety boxes before taking them to a safe place. Don’t open, empty, or reuse them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Handle and dispose of injection waste in a way that’s safe for the environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prevent accidents for the people in charge of throwing away the waste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t put empty vials in the safety box; they might burst when burned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only put potentially contaminated injection equipment in the safety boxes. Don’t put empty vials, cotton
                pads, or other things in them.
            </li>

            <li>
                Don’t use the same syringe for different patients, even if you change the needle or inject through a
                tube.
            </li>
            <li>
                Never put a used needle or syringe into a vial.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t use medications meant for one use on more than one patient.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t use a bag of IV solution for more than one patient.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use multi-dose vials for one patient if possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t keep multi-dose vials near where you treat patients. Prepare medications in a clean area away from
                any contamination, and not where you handle used syringes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wear a facemask when injecting material or placing a catheter into the epidural or subdural space.

                    </strong>
                    If the needlestick causes a small cut or puncture, gently squeeze the area to encourage bleeding.

                    If possible, identify the source patient (the person whose blood you were exposed to). This is
                    important for assessing potential infections and taking appropriate measures.

                    Depending on the situation, you may need to undergo blood tests to check for infections like HIV,
                    hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Your healthcare provider will determine if post-exposure prophylaxis
