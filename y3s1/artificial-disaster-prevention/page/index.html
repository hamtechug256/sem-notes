        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Install smoke alarms throughout your residence. These devices significantly reduce the likelihood of
                fatalities in fires. Place them on every level, outside bedrooms, at the top of stairways, and near the
                kitchen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Regularly test and clean smoke alarms, replacing batteries at least once a year. It’s also important to
                replace smoke alarms every 10 years.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintain a record of the fire brigade’s contact information, keeping it safe and accessible to all
                family members.
            </li>
            <li>
                Educate people about fire prevention and escape mechanisms to ensure they are well-informed and

                Review escape routes with your family and practice evacuation drills from each room.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure windows are easily opened and not obstructed. Install security gratings with fire safety openings

            Government Efforts to address Environmental Pollution.


        </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The government is actively involved in raising public awareness about the various types of environmental
                pollution, their effects, and the potential outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Local governments have implemented plans to reduce air pollution, which include measures to restrict the
                use of private motor vehicles and promote the use of mass transportation systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Local governments can also pass recycling laws to encourage the reuse of materials instead of disposing
                of them. For instance, in Uganda, there is a deposit-refund system for plastic bottles, incentivizing
                their return for reuse.
            </li>
            <li>
                National governments have enacted legislation to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes,
                ensuring that proper protocols are followed based on the level of hazard potential.
            </li>
            <li>
                Governments have banned the use of the dangerous pesticide DDT, except for essential purposes. Farmers
                have adopted alternative, less harmful pesticides to replace DDT.
            </li>
            <li>
                To control water pollution, the government has prohibited the use of lead oxide to seal water pipes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Environmental concerns have led to the formation of political parties representing these issues in many
                industrial nations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Governments may impose taxes on products that contribute to pollution, such as non-returnable bottles,
                encouraging companies to reduce pollution to maintain a positive image and consumer demand.

            </li>
            <li>
                Many farmers practice crop rotation, alternating crops such as maize, wheat, and legumes like alfalfa
                and soybeans, to reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and control pests and diseases.
            </li>

                Some farmers utilize compost and other environmentally friendly fertilizers, while others employ natural

                Genetically engineered plants resistant to specific pests are being developed. This approach, along with
                the use of natural controls, is known as integrated pest management (IPM), where chemical pesticides are
                used in smaller amounts and selectively.

                Conserving energy is crucial in reducing pollution. One effective way is to drive less, reducing air
                pollution and energy consumption.
            </li>
            <li>
                People can save electricity by purchasing energy-efficient light bulbs and home appliances.
                Additionally, alternative fuels like ethanol can be used in vehicles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Buildings with specially treated windows and good insulation require less fuel or electricity for
                heating and cooling, reducing energy consumption.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using fewer toxic cleaning products and properly disposing of any toxic substances can help reduce water
                pollution.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reducing meat consumption can contribute to decreasing pollution, as intensive farming practices
                associated with livestock production require large amounts of fertilizer and pesticides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reusing products is a simple yet effective way to prevent pollution. This includes using refillable
                glass bottles, reusing paper or plastic bags, and engaging in recycling initiatives.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many cities and towns organize waste collection programs for recycling. Recycling materials like metal
                cans, glass, paper, plastic containers, and old tires saves energy, raw materials, and prevents
                pollution.
