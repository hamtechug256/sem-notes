        <p>

            Once a problem has been identified the professional literature must be reviewed. This is essential in order
            to locate similar or related studies that have already been completed and upon which the study can be built.

        </p>
        <p>

            The review of literature will reveal what strategies, procedures and measuring instruments have been found
            useful in investigating the problem in questions. This information helps one to avoid mistakes that have
            been made by other researchers and also helps to benefit from research experiences.

        <p>

            When the researcher identifies a research problem and is well acquainted with the relevant literature, the
            research problem identified must be constructed  in a way that facilitates further research in a specific
            situation.

        </p>
        <p>

            The problem should be made measurable. This involves moving from a broad, vague abstractly stated problem
            and general purpose to specific objectives and questions.

        </p>
        <p>

            The objectives and questions should provide direction and specific focus and must be clearly stated.

            Communication of findings involves the development and dissemination of research reports to appropriate
