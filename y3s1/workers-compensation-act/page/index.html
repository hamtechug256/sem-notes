            Workers Compensation Act
        </h1>

        <p>
            Workers’ compensation is a system that provides cash and non-cash payments to individuals who have suffered
            loss, suffering, or injury while on the job.

                Impairment and Disability:
            </strong>

                <strong>
                    Impairment
                </strong>
            </em>
            refers to the loss of function of an organ or part of the body compared to its previous state.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                <strong>
                    Disability
                </strong>
            </em>
            , on the other hand, considers the impact of impairment on societal or work functions. It takes into account
            the loss of function and the patient’s work requirements and home situation. Disability evaluations assess
            both impairment and its effect on occupational or societal functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain agencies use a more restrictive definition of disability such as “
            <em>
                <strong>
                    inability to perform any substantial gainful work
                </strong>
            </em>
            “
        </p>
        <p>
            Others define it as an “
            <strong>
                inability to perform the essential tasks of the usual employment.
            </strong>
            ” However the determination of disability is always predicted on an assessment of impairment followed by a
            determination of the loss of occupational or societal functioning that result from the impairment

            Worker’s Compensation


        </h4>
        <p>
            Workers’ compensation act is an
            <strong>
                ACT
            </strong>
            to provide for
            <strong>
                compensation
            </strong>
            to
            <strong>
                workers
            </strong>
            for injuries suffered and scheduled diseases incurred in the course of their employment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Worker’s Compensation Act is a legal written document, which establishes the liability of employers for
            injuries to workers while on the job or illnesses due to the employment, and requiring insurance to protect
            the workers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workers’ compensation is not based on negligence of the employer, but is absolute liability for medical
            coverage, a percentage of lost wages or salary, costs of rehabilitation and retraining, and payment for any
            permanent injury (usually based on an evaluation of limitation).
        </p>
        <p>
            Compensation can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of
            disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical
            and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of health insurance). and benefits payable to the
            dependents of workers killed during employment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                N.B
            </strong>
            : General damage for pain and suffering, and punitive damages for employer negligence are generally not
            available in workers’ compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in this case.

            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s assume that an injured worker’s total monthly earnings are

            Shs.

            3,000,000/= and they have been determined to have a permanent total incapacity with an incapacitation
            percentage of 70%.
        </p>
        <p>
            To compute the compensation for permanent total incapacity, we use the formula: Total monthly earnings x 60
            months x percentage of incapacitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the given values, the computation would be as follows:
            <br />
            3,000,000/= (total monthly earnings) x 60 (months) x 0.70 (70% incapacitation) = Shs. 126,000,000/=
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in this case, the injured worker requires assistance for daily activities, such as using a
            wheelchair, feeding, and dressing. Therefore, the pay is increased by 25% of the computed amount.
        </p>
        <p>
            25% of

            Shs.

            126,000,000/=

            Shs.

            31,500,000/=
        </p>
        <p>
            So, the total compensation for permanent total incapacity, considering the additional assistance required,
            would be

            Shs.

            126,000,000 +

            Shs.

            31,500,000 =

            Shs.

            157,500,000/=
        </p>
        <p>
            This calculation ensures that the injured worker receives appropriate compensation based on their
            incapacitation and the impact it has on their ability to work.

            Factors that determine compensation claims of employees


        </h4>
        <p>
            <br />
            1.

            <em>
                Years of experience and education level.
            </em>

            <br />
            It probably goes without saying, but the more experience and education candidates have, the more money they
            can command.
            <br />
            2.

            <em>
                Industry/nature of job
            </em>

            .
            <br />
            Depending on the industry, you may have to pay vastly different wages for the same skill sets.
            <br />
            3.
            <em>

                Location

            </em>
            .
            <br />
            Location can drive compensation rates up or down, depending on the cost of living.
            <br />
            4.

            <em>
                Skill sets.
            </em>

            <br />
            When it comes to determining compensation, it might seem like second nature to search by job title; however,
            searching by job title can be unreliable. After all, a product manager at one company could have a vastly
            different role – and require a different set of skills – from a product
            <br />
            manager at another company.
            <br />
            5.

            <em>
                Supply and demand.
            </em>

            <br />
            It’s crucial to be aware of the availability of talent for the position for which you’re recruiting. If
            you’re recruiting in an area where the supply of talent outweighs the demand, you should expect to pay more
            in order to lure talent.

            Eligibility criteria for compensation


        </h4>
        <p>
            <br />
            Typically, there are four basic eligibility requirements for workers’ comp benefits:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    You must be an employee.
                </strong>
                In particular, independent contractors (like freelancers, consultants, or volunteers) typically aren’t
                entitled to workers’ compensation benefits
            </li>
            <li>
                Your employer must carry workers’ compensation insurance.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must have a work-related injury or illness.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must meet your state’s deadlines for reporting the injury and filing a workers’ compensation claim.
            </li>
        </ol>

            OVERVIEW OF THE ACT


        </h4>
        <p>
            The Act addresses matters such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assisting injured or disabled workers and their dependants,
            </li>
            <li>
                Assessing employers
            </li>
            <li>

                Steps to claiming compensation

            <li>
                <i>
                    Support a workplace where there is trust and mutual respect
                </i>
                . A negative work environment almost invites workers’ compensation losses and can inevitably make them
                worse. Injured workers can often lack motivation to get better because they don’t want to go back to a
                workplace environment they feel is unfriendly, unwelcoming or distrustful.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>
                    Inform employees of the injury reporting process
                </i>
                . The process should be part of the employee rules of conduct and provide clear step-by-step rules for
                employees to follow in the event of an injury. Employees should know to inform their supervisor of an
                injury as soon as possible, get emergency help if needed or at least see a doctor if necessary.
                Employees also need to know where to find easily accessible information about how to fill out a claim
                form, benefits available and the importance of rehabilitation and returning to work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Establish procedures to ensure that injured employees get prompt medical attention in the most
                appropriate ways. This should include establishing:
                <br />
                ✔ relationships with occupational medicine practitioners who understand your business
                <br />
                operations
                <br />
                ✓ referral program to appropriate medical specialists

            <li>
                <i>
                    Maintain a policy of reporting claims to your workers’ compensation carrier the same day they occur
                </i>
                . If a claims adjuster is able to quickly respond, this will minimize the sense of uncertainty that
                often results when someone is injured and confused about whether their claim will be handled promptly
                and equitably.
            </li>
            <li>
                Investigate the accident thoroughly. This is essential not only to quickly resolve the immediate claim
                and mitigate the loss but to prevent future losses. Your accident investigation should include;
                <br />
                ✓ Written statements from the employee-claimant and any co-workers or witnesses at the accident site.
                <br />
                ✓ Written statement from the supervisor.
                <br />
                ✓ Supporting documentation such as photographs of the accident site.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>
                    Maintain clear communications with the injured employee throughout the claims process.
                </i>
                Help them understand the process, what to expect in terms of medical treatment, payments for their
                medical treatment and status of their pay. Remind them that you support them and want to see them back
                on the job as soon as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>
                    Have an early return-to-work program
                </i>
                . They help employees recover faster by allowing them to quickly return to feeling like useful
                contributors. And they reduce the costs of temporary total disability. Arrange for employee to return to
                work in light duty/modified duty
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider the value of;
                <br />
                ✓ Future medical treatment
                <br />
                ✓ Rehabilitation
                <br />
