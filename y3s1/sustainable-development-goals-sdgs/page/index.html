            SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS)
        </h1>


        <p>

            Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in
            2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people
            enjoy peace and prosperity.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and
                that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.

            The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

        <p>

            The


            Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)


            , also known as the


            Global Goals


            , are a universal call to action to


            end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity


        </p>
        <p>

            They were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
            which sets out a 15-year plan to achieve the goals. The SDGs build on the success of the


            Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)


            , but unlike the MDGs, they are universal and apply to all countries, not just developing ones.

        </p>
        <h3>


            Key Characteristics of the SDGs:


        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>

                17 Goals and 169 Targets

                Universal Applicability


                : They apply to all countries, rich and poor, emphasizing a shared global responsibility.

            </li>
            <li>

                Integrated and Indivisible


                :


                The goals recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth
                and address a range of social needs, while tackling climate change and environmental protection.

            </li>
            <li>

                Leave No One Behind


                : A core principle of the SDGs is the commitment to ensure that the most vulnerable and marginalized
                populations are prioritized.

            </li>
            <li>

                Partnership


                : Achieving the goals requires a strong global partnership among governments, the private sector, civil
                society, and citizens.

            Mnemonic 1: The “We Can Do It” Story

            people
            have


            No Food


            get

            School


            which particularly affects


            Girls


            . To fix this, they need


            Clean Water


            and


            Electricity


            . This leads to


            Decent Jobs

            Factory


            that helps to


            Reduce Inequality


            . The factory is in a


            Sustainable City


            that practices


            Responsible Consumption


            . They also care about the


            Climate


            and the


            Ocean


            , and they protect the


            Forest


            . This peaceful and just city has


            Good Institutions


            and a strong


            Partnership


            to achieve all of these goals.
