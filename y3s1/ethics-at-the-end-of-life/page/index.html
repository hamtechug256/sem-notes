                When faced with a request for hastened death, as a nurse, it is important to:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Ensure a clear understanding of what the patient is asking for.
            </li>
            <li>
                Acknowledge and validate the patient’s suffering.
            </li>
            <li>
                Actively listen to the patient, paying attention to both verbal and non-verbal communication. Assess the
                patient for physical, psychosocial, and spiritual distress.
            </li>
            <li>
                Collaborate with the patient to develop a comprehensive care plan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inquire about the patient’s physical symptoms, including pain, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, constipation,
                insomnia, itching, and other symptoms specific to their condition. Uncontrolled symptoms can contribute
                to a request for hastened death if the patient feels it is the only escape from suffering.
            </li>
            <li>
                Explore the patient’s past experiences with death, which can provide insights into their fears and
                concerns about their own future.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify signs of depression, as it can be challenging to differentiate between physical symptoms of
                advanced illness and depressive symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify a team member who can establish a strong rapport with the patient and gain a deep understanding
                of their personal history, cultural background, and relationships. This team member can facilitate
                communication with other healthcare professionals and provide counseling support based on their
                expertise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Understand the nature of the patient’s suffering, considering all dimensions of their experience.
                Suffering arises when there is a perceived threat to the person’s integrity or continued existence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider the patient’s personal history, including previous experiences with illness and death,
                significant losses, and unfulfilled hopes and dreams, to ensure that no sources of suffering are
                overlooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Actively investigate and effectively treat symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refer the patient to palliative care specialists, anesthetists, interventional radiologists,
                psychiatrists, and psychosocial and spiritual care providers to ensure comprehensive medical,
                psychological, and spiritual treatment of the patient’s pain and other symptoms.

                : There is an ongoing debate surrounding hastened and assisted death. Advocates argue that terminally
                ill patients should have the right to die with dignity, while opponents believe that ending one’s own
                life goes against the principles of the Hippocratic Oath and the sanctity of life.
