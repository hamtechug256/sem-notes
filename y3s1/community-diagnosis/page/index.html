        <p>
            Community diagnosis refers to the process of collecting quantitative and qualitative data about a community
            to understand the health status of individuals, families, and the community as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            It involves identifying and quantifying health problems, assessing their causes and
            , and determining the population groups at risk or in need of healthcare interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Community diagnosis can be described as a comprehensive assessment of the community’s health in relation to
            its social, political, economic, physical, and biological environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The collected information should cover a range of health-related factors such as sanitation, nutrition,
            immunization, and vital statistics including birth and death rates. Additionally, community diagnosis may
            include other development issues related to the community’s well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
            The process of community diagnosis involves gathering data from various sources within the community,
            including household heads, health units, local authorities, women’s clubs, youth clubs, and extension
            workers, among others. This data collection aims to provide a holistic understanding of the community’s
            health needs, challenges, and resources. This follows
            .

            1. Initiation phase

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Define or identify the area of study from which the data is to be gathered for community diagnosis
                (i.e.  location, population size, sex and age structure, climate condition, ethnicity, economic status,
                education,  standards of living, occupation, religion, infrastructure, e.t.c).

            </li>
            <li>

                At an early stage, it is important to identify the available resources needed to determine the scope of 
                the diagnosis.

            </li>
            <li>

                In order to initiate a community Diagnosis, a dedicated committee or working group should be networked
                to  manage and coordinate the project.

            </li>
            <li>

                The committee should involve relevant parties such as government departments, health professionals  and
                non – governmental –organizations

            </li>
            <li>

                Some of the common areas to be studied may include health status, lifestyles, living conditions, 
                socioeconomic conditions, physical and social infrastructure, inequalities, as well as public health 
                services and policies, medical services, public health issues, education, housing, public security and 
                transportation

            </li>
            <li>

                Once the scope is defined, a working schedule to conduct the community diagnosis, production and 
                dissemination of reports should be set.

            </li>
        </ol>

            2.


            Data collection with analysis

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Data collection refers to gathering data about the health problems present in the community.

            </li>
            <li>

                Design the relevant tools to be used in data collection.

            </li>
            <li>

                Prepare for data collection using selected methods e.g. these can be the questionnaires, interview
                guide  or observational checklists, focus group discussions.

            </li>
            <li>

                The following sources of data can be used:

            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Discussion with community members about their main health problems

            </li>
            <li>

                Reviewing records of the health services utilized by the community

            </li>
            <li>

                Undertaking a community surveyor a small-scale project

            </li>
            <li>

                Observing the risks to health present in the community.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>

                5. Data analysis: Data analysis refers to categorizing the whole of the data you collected into groups
                so as  to make meaning out of it. For instance you can assess the magnitude of a disease by calculating
                its  prevalence and its incidence from the numbers of cases you recorded and the number of people in
                the  population in your community.

            </li>
            <li>

                6. Collected data can then be analyzed and interpreted by experts, Here are some practical tips on data 
                analysis and presentation:

            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Statistical information is best presented as rates or ratios for comparison

            </li>
            <li>

                Trends and projections are useful for monitoring changes over a time period for future planning

            </li>
            <li>

                Graphical presentation is preferred for easy understanding

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            3.


            Diagnosis

        </p>
        <p>

            Diagnosis of the community is reached from conclusions drawn from the data analysis. It should preferably 
            comprise three areas:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Health status of the community

            </li>
            <li>

                Determinants of health in the community

            </li>
            <li>

                Potential for healthy community development

                The production of the community diagnosis report is not an end in itself; efforts should be put into 
                communication to ensure that targeted actions are taken.

            </li>
            <li>

                The target audience for the community diagnosis includes policy-makers, health professionals and the 
                general public in the community.

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                As a health professional working in a community affected by several health problems at the same time  it
                is difficult to address all the problems at once. Therefore, you should give priority to the most 
                important ones first.

            </li>
            <li>

                Health problems which have a high magnitude and severity, which can be easily solved, and are major 
                concerns of the community and the government, are given the highest priority.

            </li>
            <li>

                After prioritizing which disease (or diseases) you will give most urgent attention to, the next step is
                to  develop an action plan.

            </li>

                The production of the community diagnosis report is not an end in itself; efforts should be put into 
                communication to ensure that targeted actions are taken.

            </li>
            <li>

                The target audience for the community diagnosis includes policy-makers, health professionals and the 
                general public in the community.

            </li>
            <li>

                The report can be disseminated through the following channels: presentations at meetings of the health 
                boards and committees, or forums organized for voluntary organizations, local community groups and  the
                general public through press releases or meetings.

            </li>
            <li>

                It is important to realize that Community Diagnosis is not a one-off project, but is part of a dynamic 
                process leading to health promotion in the community.

            Prioritizing health problems

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Health problems which have a high magnitude and severity, which can easily be solved, and are major
                concerns of the community and the government, are given the highest priority.

            </li>
            <li>

                After prioritizing which disease (or diseases) you will give urgent attention to, the next step is to
                develop an action plan.

            <li>

                An action plan sets out the ways in which you will implement the interventions required to prevent and
                control the disease or solve a problem.

            </li>
            <li>

                It contains a list of the objectives and corresponding interventions to be carried out, and specifies
                the responsible bodies who will be involved.

            </li>
            <li>

                It also identifies the time and any equipment needed to implement the interventions.
