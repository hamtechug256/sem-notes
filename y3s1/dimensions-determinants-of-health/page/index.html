        </h2>
        <p>
            According to WHO, health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not
            merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to WHO, the components of health include the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Physical Health:
                    </strong>
                    The state of physical health implies the notion of perfect functioning of the body, including
                    anatomical, physiological, and biochemical functioning. Every cell and organ must function optimally
                    and in perfect harmony with the rest of the body.
                </p>
            </li>

                    <strong>
                        Social Well-being:
                    </strong>
                    This refers to the level of health that enables a person to live in harmony and integration with
                    their surroundings. It includes the quantity and quality of an individual’s interpersonal ties and
                    their involvement with the community.
                </p>
            </li>

                    <strong>
                        Mental Well-being:
                    </strong>
                    A positive mental health state indicates that the individual is well adapted to both external and
                    internal stressors, has harmonious relations within the family and community spheres, and is able to
                    lead a productive life.
                </p>
            </li>

                    <strong>
                        Spiritual Dimension:
                    </strong>
                    This refers to the part of an individual that seeks meaning and purpose in life. It recognizes our
                    search for meaning and purpose in human existence.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Emotional Dimension:
                    </strong>
                    The emotional dimension involves awareness and acceptance of one’s feelings. Emotional wellness
                    includes the degree to which one feels positive and enthusiastic about oneself and life.
                </p>

            <li>

                    <strong>
                        Occupational Dimension:
                    </strong>
                    The occupational dimension recognizes personal satisfaction and enrichment in one’s life through
                    work. Work, when fully adapted to human goals, capacities, and limitations, often plays a role in
                    promoting both physical and mental health.

        <p>
            There are many influences that affect health and well-being, known as determinants of health. These

                    </strong>
                    The health of a population or an individual is greatly dependent on genetic constitution. Genetic
                    traits related to certain enzyme deficiencies and hereditary diseases can lead to changes in
                    individuals’ health status.

                    </strong>
                    Sedentary lifestyles, excessive competition, lack of regular exercise, and the excessive consumption
                    of alcohol and other substances like smoking have compromised individuals’ health status, leading to
                    non-communicable diseases.

                    </strong>
                    The physical, social, and biological environment is a crucial determinant of health. Factors such as
                    poor environmental sanitation, inadequate safe water, and excessive air and water pollution can
                    impact health.

                    Accessibility and acceptability of health facilities have a direct impact on health status.
                    Availability and utilization of primary health facilities improve the health of individuals and
                    communities.

            Health indicators


        </h4>
        <p>
            Health indicators, also referred to as health variables or health indices, are measurable characteristics of
            a population that provide insights into its health status. These indicators serve several essential roles in
            the realm of healthcare management, including description, prediction, explanation, system oversight,
            evaluation, advocacy, accountability, research, and the assessment of gender disparities.

            </strong>


        </h5>
        <p>
            Health indicators are typically classified into two main categories: vital indicators and behavioral
            indicators.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                Vital Indicators:
            </strong>

            These encompass a wide range of measures that provide critical information about the health of a population.
            Some key types of vital health indicators include:

                        Mortality Indicators:
                    </strong>
                    These indicators focus on data related to deaths within a population. They include statistics such
                    as the crude death rate (the total number of deaths per 1,000 people in a given year) and specific
                    death rates for various causes (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer).

                        Morbidity Indicators:
                    </strong>
                    Morbidity indicators provide insights into the prevalence and incidence of diseases and illnesses
                    within a population. Examples include the prevalence of diabetes or the incidence of new cases of
                    tuberculosis.

                        Disability Indicators:
                    </strong>
                    These indicators assess the prevalence of disabilities, impairments, and limitations in functioning
                    within the population.

                        Service Indicators:
                    </strong>
                    Service indicators gauge the accessibility, availability, and quality of healthcare services. This
                    category includes measures like the number of healthcare facilities per capita or the availability
                    of essential medications.

                        Comprehensive Indicators:
                    </strong>
                    Comprehensive indicators offer a more holistic view of health by combining multiple aspects of
                    well-being. They may include the Human Development Index (HDI), which factors in life expectancy,
                    education, and income.

                    </strong>
                    These indicators track changes in population size over time, which can impact healthcare resource
                    planning and allocation.

                    </strong>
                    Fertility indicators, such as the total fertility rate (TFR), provide information about the average
                    number of children born to women of childbearing age in a population.

                :
            </strong>
            In contrast to vital indicators, behavioral health indicators focus on the actions, behaviors, and attitudes
            of individuals and communities regarding healthcare. Some examples of behavioral health indicators include:
        </p>

                    </strong>
                    These indicators measure the extent to which healthcare services are accessed by the population,
                    including factors like hospital admissions, doctor visits, and preventive screenings.
