                Assessment of Learning
            </b>
            is the process of finding out how much the  learners have achieved during or after teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, it refers to all strategies employed by the teacher to determine the  extent of ability or
            performance in the learner during the instruction period or  after teaching has been done.

            <b>
                Evaluation of learning
            </b>
            is the interpretation of the teacher about the  performance of the learner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, it is the conclusion made by the teacher about the performance  of the learner depending on the
            learning objectives earlier set.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                Example:
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Assessment
            </i>
            : How much have they achieved/learnt?
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                Evaluation
            </i>
            : Is their level of achieving/learning enough according to the  teaching and learning objectives I set?
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, Evaluation is an effect of Assessment (Any evaluation starts with  assessment and any assessment
            becomes
            useless without evaluation).

            Types of Assessment and Evaluation
        </h4>
        <p>
            Assessment and evaluation are essential processes in education that help measure and interpret learning
            outcomes. Here are the three main types of assessment and evaluation:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        Pre-course/Diagnostic Assessment and Evaluation
                    </b>
                    : This type of assessment occurs before the lesson or course begins. It aims to measure and
                    interpret
                    the existing knowledge and potential of students. By assessing what students already know, teachers
                    can
                    tailor their instruction to meet the specific needs of each learner.

                        Formative Assessment and Evaluation
                    </b>
                    : Formative assessment takes place during the lesson or course and focuses on measuring and
                    interpreting
                    learning progress. It provides ongoing feedback to students, helping them identify areas of
                    improvement
                    and adjust their learning strategies accordingly. Teachers use formative assessment to monitor
                    student
                    understanding and make necessary instructional adjustments.

                        Summative Assessment and Evaluation:
                    </b>
                    Summative assessment occurs at the end of the lesson or course to measure and interpret the overall
                    learning outcomes. It evaluates students’ mastery of the subject matter and their ability to apply
                    what
                    they have learned. Summative assessments often take the form of tests, projects, or presentations
                    and
                    provide a comprehensive understanding of students’ knowledge and skills.

                    : A good assessment tool should measure what it is intended to measure. It should have well-designed
                    items or questions that accurately assess the specific knowledge or skill you want to evaluate. The
                    tool
                    should align with its intended purpose.

                    : A reliable assessment tool produces consistent results. Even when different groups of students or
                    different examiners administer the test, the outcomes should be similar. This consistency ensures
                    that
                    the tool is dependable and trustworthy.

                    convenient to administer. The materials used for the assessment should be readily available and
                    manageable. Practicality ensures that the assessment process is smooth and feasible.

                    : To ensure fairness and comparability, the assessment should be conducted under the same conditions
                    for
                    all participants. This includes having a consistent timetable, duration, and a unified marking

                    Standardization helps create a level playing field for all individuals being assessed.

                    or
                    too easy. Ideally, a reasonable percentage of students should excel (not exceeding 70%), while a
                    certain
                    percentage should not fail (not exceeding 30%). This controlled difficulty ensures a fair

                    The
                    tool should have fresh and unique content to maintain its integrity and avoid bias or

                    predetermined scores that indicate acceptable and unacceptable performance levels. These norms help
                    in
                    categorizing and evaluating the results consistently. For instance, achieving 80% and above may be
                    considered as a D1 level.

                    not
                    be influenced by personal biases or subjective interpretations. Objectivity ensures that the
                    assessment
                    is fair and impartial.
