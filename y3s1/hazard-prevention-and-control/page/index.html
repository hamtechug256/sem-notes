            HAZARD PREVENTION AND CONTROL
        </h1>

        <p>

            Hazard prevention


            is any


            workplace-specific program designed to stop the occupancy or occurrence of work-related injuries and
            diseases.

        </p>
        <p>

            Hazard control


            refers to the


            implementation of policies, standards, procedures and physical changes to eliminate or minimize adverse
            risks.

        </p>
        <p>

            Hazards


            are


            anything that can cause harm to workers, such as injuries, illnesses, or accidents.

        </p>
        <p>

            Hazard Identification


            : This is the initial step in the risk assessment process. It involves


            recognizing and listing potential hazards that may exist in a given environment.

        </p>
        <p>

            Hazard identification


            is the


            process of identifying, locating, and documenting anything that could cause harm, damage, injury, or adverse
            effects


            . This step is more qualitative and involves recognizing what hazards could be present.

        </p>
        <h4>


            Methods of hazard control/Hierarchy of Controls at the workplace


        </h4>
        <p>

            There are different methods of hazard prevention and control, which can be ranked


            according to a hierarchy of effectiveness


            . The higher the level in the hierarchy, the more effective the method is. The hierarchy of controls is as
            follows:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Elimination


                :


                Eliminating the Risk (Level One)


                :


                This is the most effective method, as it removes the hazard completely from the workplace. For example,
                cleaning spills from the floor immediately or replacing worn-out equipment or wires eliminates the risk
                of slips, trips, or electric shocks.

            </li>
            <li>

                Substitution


                :


                Substituting the Risk (Level Two)


                : This is the second most effective method, as it replaces a hazard with a less hazardous one. For
                example, using single-use syringes instead of re-usable ones reduces the risk of infection. However,
                substitution may introduce new hazards, so a new risk assessment should be done after the change.

            </li>
            <li>

                Isolation


                :


                Isolate the Risk (Level Three)


                :


                This is the third most effective method, as it separates workers from the hazard by using barriers or
                distance. For example, placing dangerous machinery in a separate room and installing remote control
                systems isolates workers from the risk of injury. Another example is using isolation rooms for patients
                with contagious diseases.

            </li>
            <li>

                Engineering controls


                :


                Engineering Controls (Level Four)


                :


                Engineering risk control is the process of designing and installing additional safety features to
                workplace equipment. These are physical modifications or additions to equipment or the work environment
                that reduce exposure to hazards. For example, installing ventilation systems in areas with harmful
                gasses or dust or guardrails on raised walkways reduces the risk of respiratory problems or falls.

            </li>
            <li>

                Administrative controls


                :


                Administrative Controls (Level Five)


                :


                These are rules, policies, procedures, or training that aim to change workers’ behavior or work
                practices to avoid or reduce hazards. For example, providing safety training on how to use equipment
                properly or arranging work schedules to limit exposure time in hazardous areas reduces the risk of human
                error or fatigue.

            </li>
            <li>

                Personal protective equipment (PPE)


                :


                Personal Protective Equipment (Level Six)


                :


                These are items that workers wear or use to protect themselves from hazards, such as hard hats, ear
                plugs, gloves, masks, etc. This is the least effective method in the hierarchy, as it does not remove or
                reduce the hazard itself. It only protects workers from harm if an incident occurs. Therefore, PPE
                should always be used in combination with other methods and as a last resort.

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>


            Considerations for Effective Control and Prevention of Hazards


        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>

                Involve workers in the process


                .


                Workers often have the best understanding of the hazards in the workplace and how they can be
                controlled.

            </li>
            <li>

                Identify and evaluate options for controlling hazards.


                Use a “hierarchy of controls” to select the most effective and permanent controls. The hierarchy of
                controls prioritizes engineering controls (such as eliminating or substituting hazards) over
                administrative controls (such as work practices) and personal protective equipment (PPE).

            </li>
            <li>

                Use a hazard control plan to guide the selection and implementation of controls.


                The hazard control plan should describe how the selected controls will be implemented and who is
                responsible for their implementation.

            </li>
            <li>

                Develop plans to protect workers during non-routine operations and emergencies.


                These plans should include procedures to control hazards that may arise during non-routine operations,
                such as maintenance and repair, and during emergencies, such as fires and explosions.

            </li>
            <li>

                Implement selected controls in the workplace.


                Implement the controls according to the hazard control plan and track progress to ensure that they are
                effective.

            </li>
            <li>

                Follow up to confirm that controls are effective.


                Track progress in implementing the controls, inspect and evaluate the controls once they are installed,
                and follow routine preventive maintenance practices.

            </li>

            Steps in Occupational Hazard Assessment and Identification


        </h4>
        <p>
            Occupational hazards are any sources of potential damage, harm or adverse effects on the health and safety
            of workers or the environment. Occupational hazard assessment and identification is the process of finding,
            recognizing, and describing the hazards that exist in the workplace, and analyzing and evaluating the risks
            associated with these hazards. The purpose of this process is to prevent or reduce the occurrence and
            severity of work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following are some steps that can be followed to conduct occupational hazard assessment and
            identification:
        </p>
        <h5>


            1. Collect existing information about workplace hazards


        </h5>
        <p>
            Before inspecting the workplace for hazards, it is useful to gather and review any information that may
            already be available from both internal and external sources. This can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                <em>
                    Inspecting the work place for safety
                </em>

                : Records of previous incidents, injuries, illnesses, near misses, complaints, or suggestions related to
                workplace hazards
            </li>
            <li>

                <em>
                    Identify hazards:
                </em>

                Safety data sheets , labels, manuals, or instructions for hazardous products or equipment used in the
                workplace.
            </li>
            <li>

                <em>
                    Conducting incident investigations:
                </em>

                Regulations, standards, codes of practice, or guidelines that apply to the workplace or the industry
            </li>
            <li>
                Reports or publications from professional associations, research institutions, government agencies, or
                other organizations that provide information on workplace hazards
            </li>
            <li>
                Input from workers, supervisors, managers, health and safety committees, unions, or other stakeholders
                who have knowledge or experience of the workplace hazards
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The collected information should be organized and reviewed with workers to determine what types of hazards
            may be present and which workers may be exposed or potentially exposed. This can help identify areas or
            activities that need more attention during the inspection.
        </p>

                2. Inspect the workplace for safety hazards
            </u>

        </h5>
        <p>
            Even if some information on workplace hazards is already available, it is still important to inspect the
            workplace regularly for any new or existing hazards that may have been overlooked or introduced over time.
            Hazards can arise from changes in workstations, processes, equipment, tools, materials, or environment. They
            can also result from poor maintenance, housekeeping, or training practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            A workplace inspection involves observing the physical conditions and work activities in the workplace, and
            identifying any hazards that could cause harm to workers or the environment. Some common methods of
            inspecting the workplace are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Walking around the workplace and looking for any obvious signs of hazards, such as spills, leaks, broken
                equipment, exposed wires, blocked exits, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Talking to workers and asking them about any concerns or issues they have regarding their work
                environment, tasks, equipment, tools, materials, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using checklists or forms to guide the inspection process and ensure that all relevant aspects of the
                workplace are covered
            </li>
            <li>
                Taking notes, photos, videos, measurements, samples, or other records of the observed hazards and their
                locations
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Workers can be a very useful internal resource for inspecting the workplace for hazards, especially if they
            are trained in how to identify and assess risks. Workers have firsthand knowledge of their work conditions
            and tasks, and may be aware of some hazards that are not obvious to others. Involving workers in the
            inspection process can also increase their awareness and participation in health and safety matters.
        </p>
        <h5>

            <u>
                3. Identify hazards associated with emergency and non-routine situations
            </u>

        </h5>
        <p>
            In addition to inspecting the workplace for regular hazards that occur during normal operations, it is also
            necessary to identify any hazards that may arise during emergency or non-routine situations. These are
            situations that are not part of the usual work activities or procedures, but may occur unexpectedly or
            occasionally due to various factors. Some examples of emergency or non-routine situations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fire
            </li>

                Emergency or non-routine situations
            </b>
            can pose different or additional risks to workers or the environment than those encountered during normal
            operations. Therefore, it is important to identify these risks beforehand and prepare appropriate measures
            to prevent or respond to them effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some ways to identify hazards associated with emergency or non-routine situations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reviewing past incidents or near misses that involved emergency or non-routine situations
            </li>
            <li>
                Consulting with experts or specialists who have knowledge or experience of dealing with emergency or
                non-routine situations
            </li>
            <li>
                Conducting scenario analysis or simulation exercises to anticipate potential outcomes and consequences
                of emergency or non-routine situations
            </li>
            <li>
                Developing emergency plans or procedures that outline the roles and responsibilities of workers and
                other parties in case of emergency or non-routine situations

        </h5>
        <p>
            After identifying all the possible hazards in the workplace, it is necessary to characterize their nature,
            identify interim control measures, and prioritize them for control.
        </p>
        <p>
            Characterizing the nature of identified hazards means describing their sources, forms, effects, and
            severity. This can help determine how likely they are to cause harm, and how serious the harm could be. Some
            factors that can be used to characterize the nature of identified hazards are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Frequency: how often the hazard occurs or is encountered
            </li>
            <li>
                Duration: how long the hazard lasts or is exposed
            </li>
            <li>
                Magnitude: how large or intense the hazard is
            </li>
            <li>
                Probability: how likely the hazard is to cause harm
            </li>

        <p>
            <b>
                Identifying interim control measures
            </b>
            means taking temporary actions to reduce or eliminate the risk of harm from the identified hazards until
            permanent solutions can be implemented. Interim control measures can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Isolating or removing the hazard from the workplace or workers
            </li>
            <li>
                Providing personal protective equipment (PPE) or other safety devices to workers
            </li>
            <li>
                Posting warning signs or labels to alert workers of the hazard
            </li>
            <li>
                Implementing administrative controls, such as limiting access, exposure, or work hours to the hazard
            </li>
            <li>
                Providing training, information, or instruction to workers on how to avoid or handle the hazard

                Prioritizing the hazards for control
            </b>
            means ranking the identified hazards according to their level of risk and urgency of action. This can help
            allocate resources and plan interventions more effectively and efficiently. Some criteria that can be used
            to prioritize the hazards for control are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Legal requirements: whether the hazard violates any laws, regulations, standards, or codes of practice
                that apply to the workplace or the industry
            </li>
            <li>
                Worker concerns: whether the hazard affects a large number of workers or causes significant distress or
                dissatisfaction among workers
            </li>
            <li>
                Cost-benefit analysis: whether the benefits of controlling the hazard outweigh the costs of doing so
            </li>
            <li>
                Hierarchy of controls: whether the hazard can be controlled by using more effective and reliable
                methods, such as elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, or PPE
            </li>

                Employers should create a culture of safety in the workplace where employees feel valued and respected.
                This means creating a workplace where employees feel comfortable speaking up about safety concerns and

                These meetings should be used to discuss safety issues and to remind employees of the importance of

                </strong>
                Employers should provide incentives for safety, such as rewards for employees who have a good safety
                record. This can help to encourage employees to be more safety conscious.

                When employees do something to improve safety, employers should celebrate their success. This can help
                to reinforce the importance of safety and to encourage employees to continue to work safely.
