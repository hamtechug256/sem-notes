            Research design acts as a blueprint for conducting a research study, outlining how variables will be
            operationalized for measurement, the selection of the sample of interest, data collection methods, and the
            intended means of data analysis.

                Experimental Study Design:
            </strong>

        </h4>
        <p>
            Experimental study design involves introducing an intervention assumed to be the ’cause’ of change and
            waiting until it has produced or has been given sufficient time to create that change. Some essential
            experimental study designs include the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            i)
            <strong>
                After-only design:
            </strong>
            In this approach, the researcher knows that the population has been exposed to an intervention. They aim to
            study its impact on the population. Information about the baseline is usually gathered from respondents’
            recall of the situation before the intervention or from existing records. This design is commonly used in
            impact assessment studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            ii)
            <strong>
                Before-and-after design:
            </strong>
            This design addresses the issue of retrospectively constructing the ‘before’ observation by establishing it
            before introducing the intervention to the study population. Subsequently, when the program is fully
            implemented or assumed to have its effect on the population, an ‘after’ observation is conducted to
            determine the intervention’s impact.

            </strong>
            In the control group design, the researcher selects two population groups – a control group and an
            experimental group. These groups are expected to be as comparable as possible in every respect except for
            the intervention. The experimental group receives or is exposed to the intervention, while the control group
            is not. Initially, the ‘before’ observation is made on both groups simultaneously. Subsequently, the
            experimental group is exposed to the intervention. When it is assumed that the intervention has had an
            impact, an ‘after’ observation is conducted on both groups. Any difference in the ‘before’ observation
            between the groups concerning the dependent variable(s) is attributed to the intervention.

            Cross-sectional study design is a research approach that involves different groups of people who vary in the
            variable of interest but share other characteristics, such as socioeconomic status, educational background,
            and ethnicity. For instance, researchers may select groups of people who are quite similar in most aspects
            but differ only in age. This allows any observed differences between groups to be attributed to age rather
            than other variables.
        </p>

            Cross-sectional studies are typically observational and are commonly used in descriptive research.

            <li>
                Unlike experimental designs that involve active intervention to induce and measure change or create

                While longitudinal studies require multiple measurements over an extended period, cross-sectional

            The primary difference between a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and a cohort study is the random
            selection of samples. RCTs involve the random allocation of participants to different clinical
            interventions, including a control group. These trials seek to measure and compare the outcomes following
            the interventions. RCTs are purely experimental and quantitative in nature.

            200 eligible men were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received Panadol tablets as pain relief
            immediately after surgery, while the other group received a placebo. The results showed that a majority
            (90%) of patients given Panadol reported no pain, whereas over 90% of patients on the placebo reported
            significant pain.

        <p>
            A case series is a descriptive study that follows a group of patients or subjects with known exposure, such

        </p>
        <p>
            Internal validity in case series studies is generally low because they lack a comparator group exposed to

            </strong>

        </h4>
        <p>
            A correlation study investigates whether two variables are correlated, meaning an increase or decrease in
            one variable corresponds to a change in the other. However, correlation does not imply causation. Three
            types of correlation exist: positive, negative, and no correlation.
        </p>
        <p>
            A correlation coefficient, which ranges from +1 to -1, is typically used to quantify the strength and
            direction of the correlation between variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>
                There are three primary types of correlation:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Positive Correlation
                    </strong>
                    : This type of correlation occurs when an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in
                    another, and a decrease in one variable is linked to a decrease in the other. For example, an
                    individual’s wealth may exhibit a positive correlation with the number of rental houses they own.
                    This suggests that as wealth increases, so does property ownership.

                        Negative Correlation
                    </strong>
                    : Negative correlation is observed when an increase in one variable is connected to a decrease in
                    another, and vice versa. For instance, there might be a negative correlation between the level of
                    education in a country and its crime rate. If education levels improve in a country, the crime rate
                    tends to decrease. However, it’s essential to note that this does not mean that a lack of education
                    directly causes crime. Both factors might share a common underlying cause, such as poverty.

                        No Correlation (Uncorrelated)
                    </strong>
                    : In cases of no correlation, changes in one variable do not correspond to changes in the other, and
                    vice versa. For example, among millionaires, there may be no correlation between their level of
                    wealth and their level of happiness. This indicates that an increase in wealth does not necessarily
                    lead to an increase in happiness.

            Comparative studies involve examining two or more cases, specimens, or events that share similarities in

            generalize findings to larger groups from which the cases originated. The plausibility of generalization
            increases when several cases from the same group are considered.

            relationship between culture and behavior. Culture in this context refers to the beliefs, values, and
            attitudes of a specific group of people. Ethnographic research methods were developed by anthropologists to
            study and describe human cultures.

            Phenomenological research is the study of phenomena, which can be events, situations, experiences, or
            concepts as they are perceived by individuals. This approach aims to understand and describe the essence of
            lived experiences from the perspective of the participants. Phenomenology begins with the acknowledgment
            that there is a gap in our understanding and that clarification will be beneficial.

        <p>
            In phenomenological research, researchers seek to explore the essence and meaning of experiences as they are
            lived. It often involves in-depth interviews and analysis to uncover the common themes and structures that
            underlie these experiences. This research design is valuable in understanding how individuals make sense of
            the world and their experiences.

            primary goal of grounded theory is to generate new, abstract theories based on empirical observations,
            rather than testing existing theories.
