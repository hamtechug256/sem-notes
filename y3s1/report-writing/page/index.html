                It provides evidence about the whole study.
            </li>
            <li>
                The researcher is required to adequately relate the findings to the research objectives.
            </li>
            <li>
                This process involves the presentation of data from the research findings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Usually a research report is presented in a report for as opposed to the proposal writing where we use
                the future tense.

            • Descriptive statistics involves organization, presentation and
            <br />
            summarization of data
            <br />
            • Analytical statistics involves organization, presentation,
            <br />
            summarization and finding an association between variables.

            • Quantitative variables can be measured in the form of numbers as
            <br />
            opposed to names or descriptions of events
            <br />
            • Qualitative varaibles can not be measured in the form of numbers but
            <br />
            rather names age degree of pain like moderate, severe pain; tribe like

        <p>
            • Data presentation is important in any research study
            <br />
            • It helps to summarize all the junk raw data into information that can
            <br />
            easily be read an appreciated by other readers of your work
            <br />
            • Data can be presented in the form of tables, figures ie graph, pie
            <br />
            chart, line graph, histograms etc
            <br />
            • These form visual aids that helps the reader to quickly understand the
            <br />

            • These help to summarize and give picture of how big, shape and
            <br />
            distribution of the study findings
            <br />
            These can be presented as;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Frequency distribution tables
            </li>
            <li>
                Grouped Frequency distribution tables
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            For a table to be clearly translated, it must be properly constructed

        <p>
            • Ensure the table has an appropriate tittle
            <br />
            • Tittle should be above the table
            <br />
            • Every table must be numbered to facilitate easy referencing
            <br />
            • Should fit on one page
            <br />
            • Column and row headings should be brief and clear
            <br />
            • Units of headings should be clearly indicated
        </p>

                Figures(graphs, charts)

        <p>
            • These help to give a valuable supplement to the statistical analysis
            <br />
            • They help to show the trends of distribution
            <br />
            • When constructing a figure, follow the same guidelines for a table but
            <br />
            the heading of a figure is usually placed below the figure
