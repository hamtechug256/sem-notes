            DISASTER

        </h3>
        <blockquote>
            Disaster is an occurrence disrupting the normal conditions of existence and causing a level of suffering
            that exceeds the capacity of adjustment of the affected community,
            <strong>

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Disaster is also defined as a sudden/unexpected catastrophic event causing serious disruption of the
            functioning of a community or society that exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope
            using its own resources.

                    Vulnerability:
                </strong>
                Is lack of capacity to deal with potential threat. Lack of information, resources and technology. There
                are many
                <br />
                aspects of vulnerability, arising from various
                <em>
                    physical, social, economic, and
                </em>
                <em>
                    environmental factors.
                </em>
                Examples may include: poor design and construction of buildings, inadequate protection of assets, lack
                of public information and awareness, limited official
                <br />
                recognition of risks and preparedness measures, and disregard for wise environmental management
                <br />
                <em>

                    There are four (4) main types of vulnerability:

                </em>
                <br />
                (a).
                <strong>
                    Physical Vulnerability
                </strong>
                may be determined by aspects such as population density levels, remoteness of a settlement, the site,
                design and materials used for critical infrastructure and for housing. Example: Wooden homes are less
                likely to collapse in an earthquake, but are more vulnerable to fire.
                <br />
                (b).
                <strong>
                    Social Vulnerability
                </strong>
                refers to the inability of people, organizations and societies to withstand adverse impacts to hazards
                due to characteristics inherent in social
                <br />
                interactions, institutions and systems of cultural values. It includes aspects related to levels of
                literacy and education, the existence of peace and security, access to basic human rights, systems of
                good governance, social equity, positive traditional values, customs and ideological beliefs and overall
                collective organizational systems  Example: When flooding occurs some citizens, such as children,
                elderly and differently-able, may be unable to protect themselves or evacuate if necessary.
                <br />
                (c).
                <strong>
                    Economic Vulnerability
                </strong>
                . The level of vulnerability is highly dependent upon the economic status of individuals, communities
                and nations i.e. the poor are usually more vulnerable to disasters because they lack the resources to
                build sturdy structures and put other engineering measures in place to protect themselves
                <br />
                from being negatively impacted by disasters. Example: Poorer families may live in squatter settlements
                because they cannot afford to live in safer (more expensive) areas.
                <br />
                (d).
                <strong>
                    Environmental Vulnerability
                </strong>
                . Natural resource depletion and resource degradation are key aspects of environmental vulnerability.
                Example: Wetlands, such as the Caroni Swamp, are sensitive to increasing salinity from sea water, and
                pollution from storm water runoff containing agricultural chemicals, eroded soils, etc.

                onsequence for people, property and environment.
                <br />
                (a).

            Causes of Disasters

        </h4>
        <p>
            1.
            <strong>
                Geological and Climatic Changes:
            </strong>
            This causes disasters if they become extreme e.g. lack or insufficiency of rain for an extended period that
            severely disturbs the hydrologic cycle in an area.
            <br />
            2.
            <strong>
                Poverty:
            </strong>
            It generally makes people vulnerable to the impact of hazards because they settle on hills that are prone to
            landslide, along the riverside invaluably flood their banks
            <br />
            3.
            <strong>
                Population Growth
            </strong>
            : More people will be forced to live and work in unsafe areas which cause increasing numbers of people will
            be competing for limited amount of resources such as employment opportunities, and land which can lead to
            conflict; this conflict may result in crisis—induced migration thereby resulting in disasters.
            <br />
            4.
            <strong>
                Rapid Urbanization
            </strong>
            : It is characterized by rural poor moving to metropolitan areas in search of economic opportunities and
            security which may cause them not find safe and desirable places to build their houses that can lead to
            human-made disasters.
            <br />
            5.
            <strong>
                Transitions in Cultural Practices
            </strong>
            : This involves cultural Introduction of new construction material to build houses or materials used
            incorrectly may lead to house that cannot withstand earthquake.
            <br />
            6.
            <strong>
                Environmental Degradation
            </strong>
            : Drought conditions exacerbated by poor cropping patterns, overgrazing, the stripping of topsoil, poor
            conservation techniques, depletion of both surface and subsurface water supply.
            <br />
            7.
            <strong>
                Lack of Awareness and Information
            </strong>
            : Lack of knowledge about protective measures, safe locations, safe evacuation routes and procedures that
            can be accessed during a disaster can lead to community to experience impacts of the disaster since they
            don’t know how to reduce the effects.
            <br />
            8.
            <strong>
                War and Civil Strife
            </strong>
            : Includes competition for scarce resources, religious or ethnic intolerance and ideological differences
            e.g. the Rwandan massacre.

            There are
            <strong>
                three
            </strong>
            phases to any disaster. The actions on emergency personnel and others professional depend on which of the

            <strong>
                PRE-IMPACT PHASE:
            </strong>
            This is an initial phase of disaster prior to the actual occurrence of warning is given at a sign of the
            first possible danger to the community.  The earliest possible warning is crucial in preventing loss of life
            and minimizing damage. It is a period when emergency preparedness plan is made, first Aids Centre is opened
            and communication is very important, time for educating the community. The nurse’s
            <em>

                role

            </em>
            is to sensitize the community assist in making emergency shelters and prepare medical equipment.

        <p>
            <strong>
                IMPACT PHASE
            </strong>
            : Occurs when disaster has actually happened; it is time for enduring hardship or injury and trying to
            survive. It is an emergency period when the individual helps neighbours and families at a “scene”, a time of

            Stages of emotional response

        </h4>
        <p>
            Victims of disaster usually go through 4 stages of emotional response.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Denial stage
                </strong>
                : Period when victims deny the magnitude of the problem or more likely may understand the problems but
                seems unaffected emotionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Strong Emotional Response
                </strong>
                : It is a stage when the person is aware but regards it as overwhelming and unbearable. Common reaction
                during this stage is fighting of feel, weeping, speaking with difficulty, trembling, and sadness. It is
                a period of counselling and reassurance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Acceptance stage
                </strong>
                : It is the time when victims begin to accept either being handicapped with one leg.” I accept disaster,
                I try to make a decision for what to do next and develop hope.” The role of a Health worker is to help
                victim develop decision making, and take specific action.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Recovery stage:
                </strong>
                It is a stage of recovery from crisis reaction. Victims feel that they are back to normal and routines
                become important again and sense of wellbeing is restored.
                <br />
                Ability to make decision and carry out plans, returns victims, develops realistic memory.
                <br />
                The role of a nurse is to resettle the victims and discuss issues of empowerment if facilities are
                accessed.
