     Introduction
    </i>
   </u>
   :
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <b>
     Mass Casualty Incident
    </b>
    : It refers to an event that results in a large number of injured individuals requiring medical attention, while there is a shortage of medical personnel to provide the necessary services.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Mass Casualty Management
    </b>
    : It involves providing on-the-spot medical care to a significant number of injured victims when there are limited medical resources available.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Casualty Management
    </b>
    : This involves providing immediate care to victims during a disaster, including rescue operations, emergency medical care, and the evacuation of trapped individuals. Triage plays a crucial role in determining the needs of injured victims.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Triage
    </b>
    : The process of sorting or categorizing victims during a disaster to maximize the number of survivors by prioritizing treatment for those who are most likely to benefit. Triage occurs at the scene of the disaster and at each stage of victim transport. Various personnel, including nurses, midwives, and allied health workers, are involved in triage operations, while physicians provide emergency care to critically injured victims.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>
    
    
    Triage or Sorting Introduction:
    
    
  </h4>
  <p>
   The goal of triage is to identify which patients require immediate treatment and prioritize their care. Triage must be conducted at every stage of the operation, from the disaster scene to the arrival of the patient at a medical facility.
  </p>
  <p>
    
    <strong>
     Aims of Triage
    </strong>
    
   :
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <u>
     <i>
      Identify priority cases
     </i>
    </u>
    : Determine the cases that require immediate attention and treatment.
   </li>
   <li>
    <u>
     <i>
      Organize and streamline case management
     </i>
    </u>
    : Efficiently manage and allocate resources for patient care.
   </li>
   <li>
    <i>
     <u>
      Minimize complications and save lives and limbs:
     </u>
    </i>
    Take appropriate actions to prevent complications and preserve the lives and limbs of the injured.
   </li>
   <li>
    <i>
     Utilize resources effectively
    </i>
    : Optimize the use of available resources to provide the best possible care to the victims.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>
    
    
    Where is Sorting Done?
    
    
  </h4>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Sorting is done at the site of the disaster if it is already managed by a medical team (state/local), or it is carried out upon the arrival of patients at a reception center or designated hospital.
   </li>
   <li>
    Approximately 60% of casualties require medical intervention, while 40% may only need first aid and follow-up care.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>
    
    
    Four Categories Coding for Triage:
    
    
  </h4>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Red (Most Urgent)
    </strong>
    : Patients with life-threatening injuries, hypoxia, shock, chest wounds, head injuries, or 20-60% burns.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Yellow (Urgent):
    </strong>
    Patients with multiple fractures, open fractures, spine injuries, etc., requiring urgent attention.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Green
    </strong>
    : Patients with non-life-threatening injuries who can wait for more than two hours for treatment, such as simple fractures, minor burns, sprains, etc.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>
     Black
    </b>
    : Dying or Dead: In a disaster, triage must prioritize the chances of survival, and victims in this category may be beyond help.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>
    
   Mass Casualty Management Committee:
    
  </h4>
  <p>
   The hospital should have a mass casualty management committee responsible for preparing the hospital’s contingency plan, coordinating with other hospitals and relevant institutions (e.g., police, fire), disseminating information, and conducting staff training.
  </p>
  <p>
   The committee should include members from medical administration, hospital administration, maintenance, emergency department, surgical department, and nursing services.
  </p>
  <h5>
    
    
    Phases of Emergency Management:
    
    
  </h5>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Phase I
    </strong>
    : Alert of a possible disaster.
   </li>
   <li>
    Phase II: The actual occurrence of the disaster, where all portions of the plan are implemented.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
   <li>
     
     Signposts
     
    : Clear signs should be posted at strategic locations in the hospital, indicating evacuation routes in case of an emergency.
   </li>
   <li>
     
     Incoming Patient Area
     
    : Typically the casualty/emergency department of the hospital, which may be extended to accommodate a larger number of patients.
   </li>
   <li>
     
     Areas in the Emergency Department
     
    : These include the triage area, resuscitation area for unstable patients, area for patients beyond salvage, area for brought-in dead, area for walking wounded, alternate area/ward for overcrowded situations, and an area to receive postoperative patients.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>
    
    
    Patient Care in Casualty
    
   :
    
  </h5>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Triage efforts focus on maximizing the number of lives saved rather than treating the sickest or most severely injured first.
   </li>
   <li>
    Nurses may assume physician roles, and physicians may work outside their specialty. Credentialing of providers may be granted on an emergency or temporary basis.
   </li>
   <li>
    Disposable supplies may be reused due to resource limitations.
   </li>
   <li>
    Providers may need to make treatment decisions based on clinical judgment if laboratory or radiology resources are exhausted.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    
    <strong>
     Nursing Services:
    </strong>
    
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Conduct an accurate bed count for available medical-surgical, ICU, and isolation beds.
   </li>
   <li>
    Coordinate with in-patient services to evaluate patients who can be rapidly discharged.
   </li>
   <li>
    Ensure the availability of required staff and supplies.
   </li>
  </ol>
