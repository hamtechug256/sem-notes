            Occupational Health and Safety
        </h1>


        <p>

            Occupational health


            is an


            area of work in public health to promote and maintain the highest degree of physical, mental and social
            well-being of workers in all occupations


            . According to WHO

        </p>
        <p>

            Occupational health


            is also defined as the


            overall well-being—physically, mentally, and socially—of individuals in relation to their work and working
            environment.

        </p>

                </i>
            </b>

            : This discipline is dedicated to preventing workers from contracting diseases or sustaining injuries as a
            result of their work. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 1995), occupational safety and health
            encompass the following multidisciplinary activities:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Protection and promotion of workers’ health by eliminating hazardous occupational factors and conditions
                that pose risks to their well-being and safety at work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhancement of workers’ physical, mental, and social well-being, supporting the development and
                maintenance of their working capacity, as well as their professional and social growth within their work
                environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Development and promotion of sustainable work environments and organizations.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Occupational health is also defined as the overall well-being—physically, mentally, and socially—of
            individuals in relation to their work and working environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            It involves both the individual’s adjustment to work and the adaptation of work to the individual (Forsman,
            1976). The WHO defines occupational health as the “promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of
            physical, mental, and social well-being of workers in all occupations.” Furthermore, the WHO considers
            occupational health services responsible for the well-being of workers and, whenever possible, their
            families as well.

            <li>

                Incident Investigation


                : The process of examining workplace incidents, accidents, or near-miss events to identify their causes
                and implement corrective measures to prevent future occurrences. Example: Investigating a workplace fall
                to determine whether it was caused by inadequate safety measures or improper equipment usage.

            </li>
            <li>

                Workplace Ergonomics


                : Designing and arranging workspaces, equipment, and tasks to fit the capabilities and limitations of
                the workers, promoting comfort, safety, and efficiency. Example: Adjusting the height and position of
                computer monitors to reduce neck strain and prevent musculoskeletal disorders.

            </li>
            <li>

                            Promoting and Maintaining Well-Being


                            :


                            When Alice arrived, she noticed the hospital had a welcoming environment. The management
                            prioritized the well-being of all employees. They ensured everyone had regular health
                            check-ups, access to mental health resources, and social activities to foster a supportive
                            community.

                            Preventing Harmful Conditions


                            :


                            On her first day, Alice attended a training session where she learned about the importance
                            of preventing harmful working conditions. The hospital had strict protocols to protect staff
                            from exposure to hazardous substances, such as proper handling of chemicals and safe
                            disposal of medical waste.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Protecting from Risks and Hazards


                            :


                            Alice was provided with personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, masks, and
                            gowns, to protect her from potential risks and hazards. The hospital also had safety
                            protocols in place, like emergency evacuation plans and regular fire drills, to ensure
                            everyone knew how to respond in case of an incident.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Creating an Enabling Environment


                            :


                            Alice’s workstation was ergonomically designed. She had a comfortable chair, a properly
                            adjusted computer screen, and a supportive mat to stand on. This setup helped prevent
                            musculoskeletal disorders and promoted her comfort while working long shifts.

                        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>

                Protecting and promoting workers’ health


                by preventing and controlling occupational diseases and accidents and eliminating hazardous factors and
                conditions at work. Example: Implementing safety protocols and providing training to prevent accidents,
                as well as monitoring and addressing any potential occupational health hazards.

            </li>
            <li>

                Developing and promoting healthy and safe work environments


                and organizations by adapting working conditions to meet the needs of workers. Example: Modifying
                workplace layouts or processes to reduce physical strain and improve worker well-being.

            </li>
            <li>

                Enhancing workers’ physical, mental, and social well-being,


                supporting their professional and social development, and maintaining their capacity to work. Example:
                Offering health and wellness programs, promoting work-life balance, and providing opportunities for
                skill development and career growth.

            </li>
            <li>

                Enabling workers to lead productive lives


                and contribute to sustainable development. Example: Supporting initiatives that foster a healthy
                work-life balance, job satisfaction, and employee engagement, which ultimately benefits both individuals
                and the organization.

            </li>
            <li>

                Providing curative and rehabilitative services


                to address any health issues or injuries that may occur in the workplace. Example: Offering medical
                treatment, rehabilitation programs, and support for workers who experience work-related injuries or
                illnesses.

            </li>
            <li>

                Ensuring immediate response


                through first aid and emergency measures for victims. Example: Establishing protocols for first aid
                training and having emergency response systems in place to provide prompt medical assistance when
                accidents occur.

        <ol>
            <li>

                The worker


                : The individual who performs the work or job e.g. a health worker

            </li>
            <li>

            The elements of work encompass the worker, the tool they utilize, the process they follow to perform the
            job, and the work environment they operate within. For example, a health worker (the
            worker
            ) administers an intramuscular injection using an injection syringe (the
            tool


            ) by following a specific set of steps (the


            process


            ), typically in a hospital or healthcare facility (the work


            environment


            )
