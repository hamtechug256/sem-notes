            Community organization


            is the process of organizing the community in such a way that they can identify and  prioritize their needs
            and objectives, develop confidence and will to achieve them by finding resources through  cooperative and
            collaborative attitude, practices and community participation.  This follows

            <strong>
                Assumptions of community organizing:
            </strong>

        </h4>
        <p>
            Those who engage in community organizing operate based on certain
            . The outlined assumptions are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Communities of people have the potential to develop the capacity to address their own problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                People possess the desire and capability to initiate and undergo change.
            </li>
            <li>
                Individuals should actively participate in decision-making processes and have control over major changes
                occurring within their communities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changes that originate from within the community and are self-driven hold greater significance and
                permanence compared to externally imposed changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Democracy necessitates cooperative participation and collective action in community affairs, and
                individuals must acquire the skills needed to facilitate this process.
            </li>
            <li>
                Communities often require assistance in organizing to address their needs, just as individuals require
                support in coping with their individual challenges.
            </li>

                        Recognizing the issue
                    </u>
                    : The process begins when someone identifies a problem within the community and takes the initiative
                    to address it. This person, known as the initial organizer, may or may not remain involved
                    throughout the entire process.
                </p>
            </li>

                        Gaining entry into the community
                    </u>
                    : If the issue is identified by someone from outside the community, it is important to gain entry
                    into the community. This involves establishing connections and building relationships with community
                    gatekeepers such as local leaders, businesses, educational institutions, political figures, or
                    activist groups.

                    : The support of community members is essential for addressing the identified problem. The initial
                    focus should be on organizing individuals who are already interested in resolving the issue
                    (executive participants).

                    </u>

                        Arriving at a solution and selecting intervention strategies:
                    </u>
                    Multiple solutions exist for community problems. The group should evaluate various alternatives
                    considering their potential outcomes, acceptability to the community, and required resources.
                    Ultimately, one or more intervention strategies are selected.

                        Implementation, evaluation, monitoring, and looping back
                    </u>
                    : These steps involve implementing the chosen intervention strategies and activities, evaluating the
                    outcomes, monitoring progress, and if necessary, revisiting previous steps in the process (looping
                    back) to modify or restructure the community organizing plan.
