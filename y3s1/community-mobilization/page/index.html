            Prioritizing refers to putting health problems in order of their importance. Guide the community to
            prioritize these identified problems.

                The


                factors that you should consider in prioritizing


                are:

                The severity of the problem: how high is the risk of serious illness, disability or death?

            </li>
            <li>



                The feasibility of addressing the problem: are the prevention and control measures effective,  available
                and affordable by the community?

            </li>
            <li>



                The level of concern of the community and the government about the problem.

                Availability of potential solutions to the problems.

            In specifying priority health needs in the community, the health workers should not fall into a danger of 
            dictating to the people or community what their problems are and which priorities to be specified.

            Health problems which have a high magnitude and severity, which can be easily solved, and are major 
            concerns of the community and the government, are given the highest priority.
