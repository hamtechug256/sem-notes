            Study Population &amp; Sampling
        </h1>


        <p>
            Study population and sampling are helpful to the researcher in that it helps to  classify the population
            that you expect to study. You are supposed to create a state that take population and provide a brief
            justification for this population and why you think it is the best population for this study

                A sample:
            </strong>
            Is a subset (a part) of a population. Ideally, a researcher should use the whole population to collect data
            but resources may not be enough. Hence one has to resort to using a sample.

            <strong>
                Sampling:
            </strong>
            is an act of selecting a small number of subjects upon which a study is conducted to represent the
            population. The result of the sample is assumed to represent the whole population. Sampling is not necessary
            if the population is small.

            In normal circumstances, the bigger the sample size, the higher the level of accuracy.

            The principle of simple random sampling is that every object has the same probability of being chosen

                Disadvantages of simple random sampling:

            In case of a heterogeneous population, one subgroup may be under or over-represented leading to bias.

            </u>

        </h5>
        <p>
            A population may have subgroups in which a researcher is interested. For example, one may want to ensure
            that both girls and boys are represented in the sample.
        </p>
        <p>
            The population is thus divided into subgroups or layers (strata) to represent the subgroups before the
            sample is drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is important is that the percentage of the subgroups in the sample must be the same as that in the
            population. For example, if the percentage of boys and girls in the population are 70% and 30% respectively,
            then the sample must also have 60% boys and 30% girls.
        </p>

        <p>
            This method relies on arranging the target population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting
            elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. However, to avoid bias, the starting element has to
            be randomly chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number in the population is divided by the required sample to get the interval.

        <p>
            <strong>
                Example:
            </strong>
            Suppose you want to sample 8 houses (sample size) from a street of 120 houses (population).
        </p>
        <p>
            120/8 = 15 (interval), so every 15th house is chosen after a random starting point between 1 and 15. If the
            random starting point is 11, then the houses selected are; 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116.

                This method is not purely random because some elements have more chances of being chosen than others.
                For example, in the above example, houses 1-15 have more chances of being selected than houses 16-120.

        <p>
            Cluster sampling is a type of sampling that involves dividing the population into groups (clusters). Then,
            one or more clusters are chosen at random (from all clusters, a random sample is made) and everyone within
            the chosen cluster is sampled.

                This method is useful when it is impossible to make a list of subjects scattered over a large area.
                Instead of making a list, a map of the area showing political, geographical, or other types of
                sub-division can be used in what we call cluster or area sampling.

            Using all the sample elements in all the selected clusters, as seen in cluster sampling above, may be
            prohibitively expensive or unnecessary. Under these circumstances, multi-stage cluster sampling becomes
            useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of using all the selected clusters, the researcher randomly selects elements from each cluster;
            however, several levels of cluster selection are applied before the final sample elements are reached.

            household surveys begin by dividing metropolitan regions into ‘districts’ (first stage). The selected
            districts into blocks, and the blocks are chosen from each selected district (second stage).
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, dwellings are listed within each selected block, and some of these dwellings are selected (third
            stage). This method makes it unnecessary to create a list of every dwelling in the region and necessary for
            only selected blocks.

                Statistical analysis of sample results is not appropriate when non-random sampling methods are used. For
                example, a researcher cannot use statistical methods to define a confidence interval around the sample
                mean.

        </h5>

        Sampling depends on the convenience of the researcher. The sample is selected on the basis of how accessible,
        convenient, and cooperative a subject may be. For example, if there are ten parishes, one can choose two
        parishes that are nearest to one.

                Purposive/Judgmental Sampling:

        </h5>

        The sampling depends entirely on the researcher’s interest and judgment. For example, one can choose to select
        only nurses on duty.

        The respondents to be included in the study are recommended by colleagues who know they can offer good data.
        Each person interviewed suggests the next respondent to interview.

                Quota Sampling:

        </h5>

        Is a non-probability version of stratified sampling. In quota sampling, a population is first segmented into
        mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgment is used to select the subjects from
        each segment based on a specified proportion.

                Accidental Sampling:

        The respondents included in the study are not deliberately selected, but the sample is incidental to prevailing
        circumstances. For example, if you stand in front of the university gate and interview every student who passes
        by.

            i) Sampling errors arise from drawing wrong conclusions or generalizing issues based on findings drawn from
            a small sample. The errors are normally less when the sample size is big, and sampling is random.

            ii) Non-probability sampling does not allow the estimation of sampling error.
